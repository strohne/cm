But you do need to check if it has been correctly set up. If you click through the workflow, and the web browser does the corresponding reaction, it means it is correct.  In this case, as you click through the workflow, you will notice from the setting area that says “cannot locate the element with existing XPath expression. And the built-in browser doesn’t paginate to the second page. This means we need to fix the Xpath and to tell Octoparse to locate the” NEXT PAGE” button precisely.     ***About Us*** Octoparse data extraction: is a #webscrapingtool #webcrawler specifically designed for scalable data extraction of various data types. It can harvest URLs, phone, email addresses, product pricing, reviews, as well as meta tag information and body text.

Cool and Quick Test";"💡 Check out the Bright Side shop (open globally!) at: http://bit.ly/2OJubyA  How good is your eyesight? Here’s a simple eyesight test that will show how sharp your eyes are.  We all know that “eyes are the windows to the soul.” Do your windows need cleaning, or are they crystal clear and give a sharp picture of the world? Take this test to find it out!  There will be 4 stages, and it will get harder and harder with every stage. The first one might seem like a piece of cake (and if you’re actually seeing a piece of cake we’ve got problems), but the further we go, the more concentration it will require. In fact, only 8 % of people can pass stage 4 because it is so hard.    You will have the same task for every question in all the stages. The task is to pick 1 out of 10 colors which is different from the rest. To pass each of the stages, you have to find that odd one out in each task. If you fail once, you fail the entire stage.    #vision #eyetest  TIMESTAMPS Stage 1 Easy 1:11 Stage 2 Normal 2:23 Stage 3 Hard 3:53 Stage 4 Very Hard 5:29 Results 7:06  SUMMARY Congratulations to all superhumans out there who made it. Your eyesight is fantastic! 92% of people failed at this task, and you managed to rock it!  There is a chance you are a tetrachromat. This smart word is used to define people who have more receptors in their eyes than others and can see more shades of different colors.   Did you manage to make it through all 4 stages? If you failed, at what stage did it happen? Let’s discuss it in the comments section!

As Octoparse simulates human interaction with a webpage, it allows you to pull all the information you see on any website, such as Twitter. For example, you can easily extract Tweets of a handler, tweets containing certain hashtags, or posted within a specific time frame, etc.   All you need to do is to grab the URL of your target webpage and paste it into Octoparse built-in browser. Within a few point-and-clicks, you will be able to create a crawler from scratch by yourself. When the extraction is completed, you can export the data into Excel sheets, CSV, HTML, SQL, or you can stream it into your database in real-time via Octoparse APIs.   Step 1: Input the URL and build a pagination 1:24 Twitter applies “Infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to first scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.  Step 2: Build a loop item to extract the data 2:28 Make sure you go into the action setting of the “extract data” step. Click on the handler, and click “extract the text of the selected element”. Repeat this action to get all the data fields you want.  Step 3: Modify the pagination setting and execute the crawler 4:03 As we want Twitter to load the content fully before the bot extracts it, let’s set up the AJAX time out as 5 seconds, to give Twitter 5 seconds to load after each scroll.   Then, set up both the scroll repeats and the wait time as 2 to make sure that Twitter loads the content successfully. Now, for each scroll, Octoparse will scroll down for 2 screens, and each screen will take 2 seconds.   Head back to the loop item setting to edit the loop time to 20. This means that the bot will repeat the scrolling for 20 times.

The two tables can be on different sheets or even on different workbooks. There is also an HLOOKUP function, which does the same thing, but with data arranged horizontally, across rows.

Word tables can often distort when you insert an image but with this tutorial you can learn how to insert an image without disrupting your table.   Microsoft Office 365 - https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/x3yAA  The above link is an affiliate link. If you click on it and purchase a product you will not pay a penny more but I will gain a small commission to help keep the lights on!!!  I used to format each individual one to the correct size and position.  When continuing to type these images would become distorted, disappear, or be cut in half across the page...extremely frustrating...  However....   This videos shows you how to drag and drop images into a word document without the images exploding across the page and nudging all your typing where you don't want it.  This method  allows you to easily control the size of the images particularly when inserting a number of images into one document.   Purchase Microsoft Office for PC here - https://amzn.to/2L4FM7K    I may earn a small commission from my endorsements, recommendations, testimonials and/or link to any products or services from this website.  First, insert a table from the ‘table’ icon in the ‘INSERT’ tab. Your table can contain as many rows and columns as you want, but remember this will dictate how many images will be displayed on your page.  At this stage you can adjust the margins if you need the images closer to the edge of your page. If your table doesn’t adjust to the margin change, just delete it and re-insert it (that’s why you should do it at this stage).  It’s now time to adjust the size of your table cells to fit your images into.  Select the table by clicking and dragging your cursor across the whole table or clicking the square at the top left corner of the table. In TABLE TOOL under the ‘Layout’ tab you will see the width and height boxes and it’s here you can enter your chosen sizes. You will need to play around with these measurements to suit your requirements.  Once you have created the perfect table to insert images you can now remove the borders and only leave a faint dotted line that won’t appear when printed or saved as a PDF. To achieve this highlight the table as before and in the HOME tab click on ‘borders’ and a drop down menu will appear with border options, click on ‘no borders’. If your border completely disappear click on the same border tab again and go to the bottom and click on ‘show gridlines’. You should now see a faint border lines. Now this is where the crucial part takes place. You have to tell Word NOT TO MOVE THE TABLE BORDERS AND SET THEM IN STONE….RIGID….WITHOUT MOVING.  Highlight the table once again, go to TALE TOOLS – LAYOUT and click on ‘Autofit’ and simply click on ‘fixed column width’.  This will fix the width of your columns, but WAIT, we’re not finished just yet, we have to fix the height in place. To do this we need to once again make sure the table is highlighted and right click anywhere on the table.  A drop-down menu will now appear, scroll down to TABLE PROPERTIES, you will now see a dialogue box, click on the ‘columns’ tab and where is says ‘row height is’ and a dialogue box saying ‘at least’, click on the down arrow to the right and you should see the option to click ‘exactly’ (this is the little magic button). Click on this option and click OK.  Your table is now pinned in place and the cells are not going to budge when you insert your images.  It’s not time to insert those images.  Simply drag and drop your images into the word document. Drop the images one at a time into each cell and they will automatically resize to fit the cell. If you find the image is too small you will have to crop the image to fit the dimensions of your cells.  In order to CENTRE your images you simply highlight the table and check the ‘centre’ icon under the HOME table.  Is it looking good? I you need to split your table so you can insert some text or simply separate the rows, click on the row BELOW the split, go to TABLE TOOLS – LAYOUT and the click on ‘split table’. EASY!! Before I discovered this method of dragging and dropping images into word I was spending endless hours trying to correct the images, the sizes and where they landed on the page.  To say I was frustrated was an understatement.  It was part of my business, so giving up so much time to formatting documents meant my income per hour was dwindling and the bigger the project the more time I spent. Once I figured out this method it was such a relief, in fact I think I may have jumped for joy!!! I then made template for my projects with formatted tables ready to go.

This is a perfect opportunity to follow along and build this application together with us, and add it to your portfolio as it will help you land your next job. If you finish the app, tag me on social media and I will give you feedback.  We will start building the Whatsapp clone from scratch, starting from setting up a React Native project using Expo and finishing with connecting the application with a GraphQL backend using AWS Amplify. We will walk through designing the UI layout of the app, structuring everything in components, and putting everything together. We will also implement navigation between screens, header bars, and tab bars for the Whatsapp menu.   For the backend, we will be using AWS Amplify, which is an amazing combination of tools and services from AWS, that helps us build mobile and web applications faster. It offers pre-made authentication components and flows, database, API (REST and GraphQL), storage, and much more. We will be using Graphql subscriptions for the realtime chat functionalities  Doing the Whatsapp clone yourself is a great opportunity to practice React Native, modern Javascript, Typescript, AWS Amplify. We are always trying to use the latest technologies and best practices, so that's another opportunity to learn something new, being it functional components, hooks, state, navigations or AWS and Amplify.

If you find the image is too small you will have to crop the image to fit the dimensions of your cells.  In order to CENTRE your images you simply highlight the table and check the ‘centre’ icon under the HOME table.  Is it looking good? I you need to split your table so you can insert some text or simply separate the rows, click on the row BELOW the split, go to TABLE TOOLS – LAYOUT and the click on ‘split table’. EASY!! Before I discovered this method of dragging and dropping images into word I was spending endless hours trying to correct the images, the sizes and where they landed on the page.  To say I was frustrated was an understatement.  It was part of my business, so giving up so much time to formatting documents meant my income per hour was dwindling and the bigger the project the more time I spent.";"UC4zG2S6d8aUnJwwlaAP3SKA";"Lisa Doe"

The point of a watermark stamp is to inform your colleagues the status of your document, so that they don't for example, send the DRAFT presentation onto a client or colleague as final, or  accidentally share a CONFIDENTIAL file outside of your organization.  Whatever kind of watermark you are adding to your slides as a background image, the first questions you want to ask yourself before you start making it are:   1. Do you want your watermark on all of your PowerPoint slides as a background image, or just on a few of them?  2. Do you want your watermark to be editable in the normal view, or do you want it to be non-editable?  The reason these questions are important is they determine where you add the draft or confidential watermark within your presentation as the background image.  Assuming you want your draft or confidential stamp on all of your slides as a text background that is NOT editable, you want to add the watermark on your PowerPoint slide master.  If you just want your draft watermark on a single slide, simply add the watermark on the child slide layout within your slide master (see video for instructions).  If you want your draft watermark on all of your slides within you presentation, you'll want to add it to the Parent Slide (see video for instructions and demo).  Two methods for adding your watermark stamp are:  1. You can add the stamp using text, creating a text background 2. You can add the stamp using an image, creating an image background (in this case it will be draft picture instead of draft text)  Which ever method you choose, you want to make sure that your stamp is sent to the back of your slide, so that your draft or confidential watermark shows up behind everything else on your slide.  If you use a draft picture to create your stamp, I recommend using the picture tools to washout the picture, so that it actually looks like a draft stamp. If your image is too sharp, your stamp will be too distracting.  Remember, you are just trying to indicate the status of a document (draft, confidential, top secret, etc.) you are not trying to have the stamp or watermark, dominate your slide.

So I’m glad you’re back. We’re still talking about creating a mail merge document and this is part 2. We want to go ahead and continue where we left off in part 1. So let me go ahead and flip over to our main document and we will go ahead and get it set up. We’re going to go ahead and set up the basics of this letter. Let’s say that the first thing that we want to put in here is the date. So I’ll go ahead and put in here May 14, 2016 and we’ll drop down a couple lines. And here what we want to do is actually pull in some merge fields. What I’d like to have is the person’s first and last name, their company, maybe the street address, things like that.   We have a couple of options as far as this is concerned. First of all I want you to notice over here that we can put in an address block. So let me show you what the choices are if you do this. Here we can actually put in the person’s name and they give you several different choices of how you want the name to appear. You can check or uncheck whether you want the company name in here and also their address. Over here is a preview of what it’s going to look like. If that’s all you want you can certainly click OK and here’s what the merge field would look like. Now what it doesn’t give you the choice to do here is to put Attention so-and-so, maybe rearrange the company and have it first. So I’m going to go ahead and backspace over that and delete it. And let me show you how you have a little more control over the fields and how it looks by using what we call the Insert Merge Field option right up here.  If you click the down arrow you’ll notice here are all of your merge fields. What you’re going to do is you’re going to click on these the way you’d like them to appear. So let’s say I want Company Name first. Now I’m going to hit the Enter key and now what I’d like to do is have the person’s title, I put a space in there because if you don’t put a space it’ll just run altogether there. I’ll put in their first name, space and their last name. Now let’s say I’d really like it to say Attention.   Now notice I’m just typing the Attention right in front of it. Now I’m going to go ahead and go to the end of that line and hit the Enter key. I’m going to put in the next merge field which is their Address. The next one I’ll do City. And again you have to put in the commas and spaces or it’s all going to run together. Here’s State and here’s Zip Code. So now I have a lot more control over how I want the fields to appear. So whichever one works for you is certainly okay.   Now let’s say the next line is going to say Dear and we’re going to put in the person’s title and their last name. So what I’m going to do here is I’m going to add the Title and put a space and I’ll put in their last name. And of course if you want a comma or any of that you can certainly do that. Now you’re going to put the letter in.    Sorry, we couldn't fit the entire video transcription here since YouTube only allows 5000 characters.";"UC-3e3hAUhDV2lwcoQGD2grg";"Simon Sez IT"

The data we need is title, url and price. If the data spans multiple pages, we also want to scrape those.  1:22 Data Scraping wizard The built-in wizard for data scraping is used to easily scrape our information of Amazon. To store our data a Data Table is defined in the outout. You can see a Data Table as an Excel sheet, but only existing while the workflow runs. Therefore we need to write out the Data Table to an Excel sheet to save the data.  2:33 Data spanning multiple pages UiPath prompts us automatically to indicate if our data is spanning multiple pages. If yes, we simply just indicate the 'Next page' icon.  3:15 Open Browser Automatically open the browser to automate in.  3:58 Write the extracted data to Excel Using an Excel Application Scope and a Write Range we can write our Data Table to an Excel sheet.

In this case, as you click through the workflow, you will notice from the setting area that says “cannot locate the element with existing XPath expression. And the built-in browser doesn’t paginate to the second page. This means we need to fix the Xpath and to tell Octoparse to locate the” NEXT PAGE” button precisely.    ***Ajax & Xpath*** To learn more about AJAX click https://youtu.be/MuOC1yCKai0 To learn more about XPath click https://youtu.be/kZwD6szlvas   ***FREE TRIAL***  Start FREE 14-Day Pro Trial https://www.octoparse.com/subscribe/t...

Thanks to this structure, data mining from modern and dynamic websites such as Amazon, Tripadvisor, eBay, as well as from lesser-known sites is effortless.  Data extraction is run on your browser and doesn’t require anything to be installed on your computer. You don't need Python, PHP, or JavaScript coding experience to start scraping. Additionally, it is possible to completely automate data extraction in Web Scraper Cloud.  Once the data is scraped, download it as a CSV file that can be further imported into Excel, Google Sheets, etc.   Features Web Scraper is a simple web scraping tool that allows you to use many advanced features to get the exact information you are looking for. It offers features like:  * Data scraping from multiple pages;  * Multiple data extraction types (text, images, URL’s, and more);  * Scraping data from dynamic pages (JavaScript + AJAX, infinite scroll);  * Browsing scraped data;  * Exporting scraped data from a website to Excel; It is dependent only on the web browser; therefore, no extra software needed for you to start scraping.

Install the extension and open the Web Scraper tab in developer tools (which has to be placed at the bottom of the screen);  2. Create a new sitemap;  3. Add data extraction selectors to the sitemap;  4. Lastly, launch the scraper and export scraped data. It’s as easy as that!  What can Web Scraper be used for?  * Lead generation - email, phone number, other contact detail related data mining from various websites;    * E-commerce - product data extraction, product price scraping, description, URL extraction, image retrieving, etc;  * Website content crawling - extract information from news portals, blogs, forums and so on;  * Retail monitoring - monitor product performance, competitor or supplier stock and pricing, etc;  * Brand monitoring - product review, social content crawling for sentiment analysis;  * Business intelligence - gather data for key business decisions, learn from your competitors;  * Big data extraction for machine learning, marketing, business strategy developments, researches;  * And much more.

This tutorial is for people that want to create a webshop from scratch and for people that already have a Wordpress website and want to extend it with a webshop.  I will show you how to get your own domain name and Webhosting. We will install Wordpress and install a pre-made website and I will show you how you can adjust it.  After that, we will install WooCommerce. An amazing free plugin that enables you to sell products on your website.  Then we will create 6 different kinds of products. 1. A simple product. 2. A variable product where the visitor has more options for one product. For instance the color and the size. 3. A virtual product like a Coaching call. 4. A downloadable product like an eBook or a ticket to a concert. 5. An affiliate product so you can get a commission when somebody buys something through your unique affiliate link 6. A grouped product where you can add more versions of the same product to your cart. Like a Smartphone or USB Stick with different sizes  For each product, we will talk about the configuration options. Besides that, we will talk about categories and tags.  You will learn how to adjust the shop page and add widgets to your sidebar, so people can filter products based on the price, navigate through categories, see our featured or discounted products and see what they have in their cart.  When we go to the cart page you see a beautiful overview of what the visitors have in their cart. We will talk about coupon codes, like 10% or $ 10 discount free shipping, and set rules for those coupons. Like only for the first 25 visitors, or that the coupon code is only applicable for a certain product.  Then, there is shipping. I will show you how to calculate shipping based on the address, the total amount of the cart, or the weight of what is in the cart.  We will talk about Taxes. How you can set it up manually, with different countries, states, normal and reduced taxes rates and I will show you how to apply these settings automatically.  And then, we will talk about payment methods so that visitors can go to the checkout page, finish their order and pay money that will be added to your bank account.  I will show you can handle incoming orders and keep your buyers up to date with the progress of the order.

I am now 10,000 words into my PhD Thesis literature review and in an attempt to organise all my references, I came up with an excel template so all my citations and notes are in the same place, and organised into the different sections of my writing. One regret I have about this system is I WISH I WOULD HAVE STARTED IT EARLIER! So whatever point you are at in your PhD, undergraduate degree, college or school, start collecting your citations and notes in this way and you will find writing your future projects SO much easier!  Give this a go if you are also on a quest to get your notes more in order and smash out the words for your assignment!   #LiteratureReview #ReferenceOrganisation #PhDThesisWriting  For more on my thesis writing antics, follow my social media:  Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/julia.ravey.science/  TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@juliaraveyscience  Website: https://www.juliaraveyscience.com/";"UC6ldgNfnY5ikBkKobm_HFPQ";"Julia Ravey Science"

With just a few lines of code you can add real-time location tracking, geofencing, and Google Maps like direction and places features.  WebHose - WebHose basically scrapes the entire internet and then organizes the content to make it easily accessible via API  People Data Labs - This API is kind of creepy, but also interesting. I'm not exactly sure how they acquire their data but People Data labs allows you to ""enrich"" profiles of users on your app.  Crawlera -  automatically rotates IP addresses and makes it look like your scraper is coming from real people rather than an automated program  SpaceX API - A pretty simple API compared to the other ones, but still interesting I think. Just hit the endpoint from your app and retrieve all sorts of data related to SpaceX launches and rockets.  Segment - Segment is used to connect data sources from various apps and technologies. Instead of having to build and maintain all these connections between data sources yourself, you just need to work with Segment's API.";"UCzYV9nBadlQdBMPP2ZuDvKA";"Renaissance Engineer"

Please subscribe and leave comments below! **** A full transcript can be found at www.marblejar.net. ****  Hi, everyone.  This is Lara Hammock from the Marble Jar channel and in today's video I'll give you some tips on organizing and outlining your writing assignment.  I did a video a little while ago that shows the step by step process of writing a research paper, but what I don't cover in detail, is how to outline and organize the paper itself.  This video may not structure your paper for you, but it should provide some tips to get you started.There are really two types of writing: creative writing and analytical writing.  Most of the assignments that you will receive fall into the category of analytical writing.  When I was in undergraduate, I used spend A LOT of time working on a really creative introduction, literary writing, and snazzy transitions between concepts.  It turns out, I was spending my energy in the wrong place.  This is my second time going through graduate school, but during my first master's, I had my husband read and edit some of my writing.  He gave me some blunt advice that was distilled from several years of brutal writing training in law school.  Be clear, be concise, and make your organization super obvious.  I remember thinking ""What?  Where is the magic in that?""  And the answer is -- there is no magic.  And in most cases, the more ""magic"" you put in your writing, the less clear and straightforward it is -- and therefore, the less good a paper it is.  I will talk a little more about HOW to be clear and obvious in a minute.  But first, why is it important?  Well, turns out teachers and professors are human too.  And they do not live inside your head, nor are they mind readers.  So, if you have some brilliant analytical argument, you need to spell it out as clearly and bluntly as you possibly can, so that your professor understands it.  In addition, flowery language and run-on sentences only prevent easy understanding.  Professors generally have a rubric that helps them grade the paper with certain points that you have to cover.  DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO HIDE THESE POINTS.  In fact, the more signposts that you can use to make it clear that you are covering those points, the easier it will be for the professor to give you a good grade.  And what is the best way to ensure you have covered all of those points?  Using an  Outline Making an outline is crucial.  Unless you are a crystal clear thinker who can offer an off-the-cuff well-reasoned argument without taking a breath, you shouldn't attempt to write without an outline.  Why?  Because without one you will ramble, you will write in stream of consciousness, and you will miss major points that are required in the instructions.  How can you make your organization structure obvious, if you don't have an organization structure at all?  The outline provides you with one and keeps you on task.  It's really just a listing of all of the things you will be discussing in the order that you will cover them.  So,How Do You Make an Outline?I can think of 4 ways.    * Instructions - The first thing to do is look at the assignment.  Usually, the bones of your outline are already embedded in the instructions.  Say your instructions are this:    * You can see the professor has already basically structured your paper for you.  So, since you will always have an introduction and conclusion, your initial outline might look like this:    * Introduction - 1/2 pg    * Definition of term - 1/2 pg    * Biopsychosocial Spiritual Framework - 1 pg     * Definition     * Relevance to SW practice    * Understanding a specific population or social problem - 1 pg    * Conclusion - 1 paragraph   * Now you just need to fill in the details of this outline before you start writing.  If your instructions are more detailed, I would paste all of that directly into your outline.  What if you don't have such detailed instructions?  Then you may want to try the 2nd method, taking your outline from an  * Exemplar - I'm pretty new to this idea, but lots of classes seem to use these.  These are examples of outstanding papers written by past students that the professor is willing to share with the class.  I don't like to read the papers all the way through since I don't want to unwittingly influence the content of my paper, but what I like to do is use their organizational structure.  After all, the professor seemed to think this was an excellent paper, so the organization must have been pretty good.  So, I will note paragraph by paragraph what the writer is doing and then use that structure for my own paper.  Okay, so you have no detailed instructions and no exemplars?  You can always search the internet for the 3rd method . . .";"UCS96MCsAEe5OaczQjV941zQ";"Marble Jar Channel"

First we build a machine learning algorithm, or model, which we use to determine whether a tweet is positive or negative. After that we connect to the Twitter API and get the latest 100 tweets about a company. We then analyse the 100 tweets and come up with a ratio, which is equal to the amount of positive tweets divided by the amount of negative tweets. The higher the ratio is, the more positive the overall sentiment is. The lower the ratio is, the more negative the overall sentiment is. The bot will buy the 5 stocks that have the highest sentiment value from the list of 30 stocks, and sell, or short, the 5 stocks that have the lowest sentiment value from the list. Every 15 minutes the bot rebalances its holdings and reruns the sentiment analysis.  I ran the bot for 15 days, and didn't touch it.

Working out whether it’s a good or bad review is pretty easy right?   You, read it, then you get a ‘feel’ for whether it’s good or bad.   Well, now imagine you have 500 review, or 5,000 or even 5 million.   Getting through all of these and working out which of them is REALLY bad or REALLY good is a whole lotta work. This is where sentiment analysis comes in. It allows you to leverage natural language processing to help speed up this process and work out whether something is good or bad. And because you’re able to do it using code…you can do it FAST. In this video you’ll get to do just that. You’ll learn how to apply sentiment analysis to the #PresidentialDebate Twitter feed in order to calculate overall sentiment (positive or negative) for each presidential candidate.   In this video you’ll learn how to: 1. Setting up Twitter Dev 2. Querying #PresidentialDebate tweets from Twitter using Python 3. Using NLTK and TextBlob to calculate sentiment  When using TextBlob for sentiment analysis, you’re able to extract polarity and subjectivity. Polarity refers to how positive or negative something is with the range extending from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). Subjectivity refers to how much a piece of text is based on emotion with 0 being the least subjective and 1 being the most subjective.  Sentiment Analysis can also (and is typically) used for: * Market research * Customer feedback * Financial markets analysis  Note: All content, ideas and opinions are my own!

See more options trading videos: http://ow.ly/ODhHs  On today's Skinny on Options Data Science, Tom and Tony are joined by Mike Rechenthin, PhD (Dr. Data) to discuss how some traders are using sentiment analysis to learn the opinions about specific stocks of thousands of people on social media websites (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo Finance message boards).  Dr. Data first explains the algorithm behind sentiment analysis; then describes some of its shortcomings and how the number can be manipulated.  While he believes it has useful applications in fields like marketing, he doubts its usefulness for predicting the opinions of investors.  Instead of using sentiment analysis to determine a positive or negative opinion of a stock, he suggests relying more on another measure of investor sentiment, an option’s implied volatility.  Math is the most feared four-lettered word around, even to Tom and Tony. Luckily the well dressed Dr. Data is here to show how to tame the beast and even use it to make money.

Linear Regression is the statistical model that is used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors. The first one is which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable and the second one is how significant is the regression line to make predictions with the highest possible accuracy. Linear regression is used in stock price prediction, weather forecasting, sales analysis, etc.  Become an expert in data analytics using the R programming language in this data science certification training course.

But how does one actually become a data scientist? Our step by step guide will walk you through how to start a career in data science!  You can ask around, read Quora answers, or talk to someone in the industry, sure, these methods will supply you with information, but there’s no doubt that this information will be biased towards someone else’s personal experience. How others became data scientists is of little importance to you, I bet. What you’re interested in is whether YOU can become one. Are your skills appropriate for this field? What steps do you need to take to become a successful data scientist? Will your background affect the chances of becoming a data scientist? All valid questions.  If you want to become a data scientist, you should answer questions like one.  A data scientist wouldn’t take the experience and background of just one or two other data scientists and accept them as a quintessential guide. So, how much data would be statistically adequate to give us an idea of what it takes to become a data scientist? 100 profiles? 500? How about 1,001?

Power Query is like an Instant Miracle Cure to your difficult data analysis problems.   ★ Get the Official XelPlus MERCH: https://xelplus.creator-spring.com/  Here's the problem...  Excel Power Query has been a part of Excel since Excel 2016! It's in the Data tab under Get and Transform. Unfortunately many people haven't explored what it has to offer! They continue doing things the old ""manual"" way, Or the ""complex"" way with difficult formulas.  And something else you may not know ...  Generally, when you learn something, the more effort you put in, the more you get out. But it's NOT the same with learning Power Query! If you just put in a little effort, you get SO much in return! This is the difference with learning Power Query to learning other skills like VBA.  And that’s why I created this course!  To give you the tools to really make a difference at your workplace.

Phoneinfoga will still work in this guide, but for the others, you can try using each company's individual tool instead. You can see how it used to work, however, in this video and on null-byte.com.  When running an OSINT investigation, a phone number can prove to be extremely useful in gathering information about a target. On this episode of Cyber Weapons Lab, we'll explore a couple tools you can use to extract information from a phone number.

Check the course landing page for more info.  You'd like to bring data from a web page into Excel? Instead of copying and pasting, use ""Get and Transform"" (Power Query) from the ""Data"" tab. This way you can import website data properly into Excel. Once you create a web query you can automatically get the latest data in Excel. You just have to refresh your query and update the query settings so it runs a refresh at specific intervals defined by you.   Getting data from a web page has never been easier. Just Open Excel, go to the ""Data"" tab and click on ""From Web"". Enter the web address of the external page you'd like to import. Power Query opens and tries to find the html tables on that web page. Select the correct table and transform your data. This step gives you the ability to customize your output. You can for example, fill in the blanks by automatically copying down the top values. You can remove the columns you don't need and clean up the data. Once done, you can view the data in an Excel table, as an Excel Pivot Table or create a connection to the query.  Note: Importing web data with Power Query this way requires the tables on the web pages to be in HTML format - otherwise they're not recognized in the Navigator view.

In his organization, two people were working on this project and he needed to produce a consolidated Excel worksheet.  Fortunately, when I look at the workbooks he sent me, I noticed that both had a MemberID field that contained the Unique Account Numbers. With this knowledge, I decided that the VLOOKUP Function would be the easiest way to complete this task.  Here is a list of the Excel Techniques that I demonstrate in this tutorial: * Move or Copy a worksheet to another Excel Workbook * Create a Named Range to use as the ""Table_array"" in the VLOOKUP Function * Use ""Mixed Cell References"" - e.g. $A4 - in VLOOKUP Function * Use FALSE as the optional 4th Argument in VLOOKUP to produce an ""Exact Match"" * Use IFERROR Function to prevent Error Messages from appearing  I invite you to visit my secure online shopping website - http://shop.thecompanyrocks.com - to examine the many training resources that I offer for sale.

Whether you are a high school student struggling with math and science, or a college student studying engineering, math, physics, etc and are doing well, the techniques taught are meant for you.  Becoming strong in math and science is not something that happens over night. You need to consistently be practicing and studying while using the tips talked about in the book.  Two modes of thinking to remember include focused mode and diffuse mode thinking. These are where you are focused intensely on a problem, then when you let your mind wander and are more relaxed respectively. In order to excel in subjects that especially involve creativity, you need to participate in both forms of thinking.  Some tips to help avoid procrastination include trying the Pomodoro technique, focusing on the process over the product, do the most disliked jobs first, and use mental contrasting. Remember you can't learn math and science on a deep level in one night. It's important you focus on learning a little everyday and don't put off homework until the last minute because your brain won't be able to learn absorb all the material on an optimal level.";"UCpCSAcbqs-sjEVfk_hMfY9w";"Zach Star"

This Excel trick is extremely useful in situations where you have a huge dataset and you want to extract part of it by making a selection.   0:00 Intro to the dataset 2:15 Creating a Drop-down List 3:30 Adding Helper Columns to have the formula that will help extract the data 8:18 Extract Data based on the drop-down selection  For example, suppose you have the sales transaction records or various products. You can use this technique to select the product item from the excel drop-down list and all the records for that item would get extracted and listed separately.   Since this is dynamic, you can change the selection from the drop-down, and the results would update instantly.  There are three steps in extracting data based on a drop-down selection: 1. Create a Unique list of items. 2. Create a drop-down to display these unique items. 3. Use helper columns to extract the records for the selected item.  It also uses Excel formulas (INDEX, MATCH, ROWS, and SMALL functions) to extract the data based on the drop-down selection. It can work for extracting the data on the same or different worksheet in Excel  This is a great way to give the user the flexibility to quickly filter the data and get the records that they need.   For example, you can create this to quickly extract the data based on the selection of country name from the drop-down. As soon you the selection is made, this will filter all the records for that specific country.   And you can select another country from the drop-down and it will instantly update and show you the results from the second country.   You can also extend the concept shown in this video to create multiple filters. For example, you can select country and product name and it will extract the data of records that match both the criteria.

It is very close to data mining.  While many machine learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data – over and over, faster and faster – is a recent development. Here are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:  The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car? The essence of machine learning. Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life. Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with linguistic rule creation. Fraud detection?

Data forms the backbone of any analysis that you do in Excel. And when it comes to data, there are tons of things that can go wrong – be it the structure, placement, formatting, extra spaces, and so on.  Excel can be an amazing tool for data analysis. But we hardly get the data that can be used right away. And bad data leads to bad analysis.  Cleaning the raw data that you get in Excel will depend on what type and structure of data you get. There are a lot of things you can do before-hand to make sure your raw data get cleaned and ready for use.  Excel has a lot of formulas and functionalities that can help you clean your data. For example, you can use a formula such as TRIM to clean your data of leading, trailing, and double spaces. Or you can use the remove duplicate functionality to remove any occurrence of duplicate records.  The following data cleaning techniques are covered in this video:  0:00 Get Rid of Extra Spaces (leading, trailing, and extra spaces between words) 1:20 Select and remove All Blank Cells/rows 2:38 Convert Numbers Stored as Text into Numbers 5:00 Remove Duplicates cells/records 7:21 Highlight cells that contain Errors 9:24 Change Text to Lower/Upper/Proper Case to make it all consistent 10:54 Parse Data Using Text to Column  13:15 Spell Check (using a keyboard shortcut) 13:54 Delete all Formatting 14:33 Use Find and Replace to Clean Data in Excel  The data cleansing techniques covered in this video are some of the most common ones that you can use as soon as you get your raw data. Again, based on your dataset, you may need to add more to it.  Read the full tutorial here: https://trumpexcel.com/clean-data-in-excel/  Also, I have made all of my Excel courses available for FREE.

For details you can visit our website: http://www.familycomputerclub.com Query of a website visitor: 'I have a question about a project I am trying to do. I don't know much about lines of code, but do you think it is hard to design a calculator that can do something like this:  Ex1: Say I only have red, yellows, and blue M&Ms and the questions were asked like this:  How many M&Ms do you want?  12 M&Ms  How many M&Ms do you want to be red?  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12  I select 6  How many blue M&Ms do you want?  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  I select 3  Automatically there is a calculator running behind the scenes and it adds 3 yellow M&Ms now. It does this because the calculator already *knows* I want 12 M&Ms, I only have 6 red and 3 blue, and automatically completes the cart. Also you can tell that it removed 7 - 12 because clearly I can't select those if I only want 12 M&Ms.  Ex2: Select the packaging you want your M&Ms to be in:  Standard, Box, or Wrapping  If I select ""Box"" it automatically will add a $5 charge to a list that will eventually add everything up and produce a total. So even though it says ""Box"" as the clickable button, the simple calculator knows Box = $5.  Is it difficult to make something like that? I appreciate any tips you can give me. Thank you for your time.' Based on this question we have designed a userform with labels, list-box, textboxes, option buttons and a command button. The command button is coded appropriately to automate the inputs and calculations. The code is given below: Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()  TextBox3 = 12 - (Val(TextBox1) + Val(TextBox2))  If OptionButton1.Value = True Then  TextBox4 = Val(TextBox1) * 1.5 + Val(TextBox2) * 1.7 + Val(TextBox3) * 1.8 + 5 Else TextBox4 = Val(TextBox1) * 1.5 + Val(TextBox2) * 1.7 + Val(TextBox3) * 1.8 + 10 End If Range(""A3"") = ListBox1.Value Range(""B3"") = TextBox1.Text Range(""C3"") = TextBox2.Text Range(""D3"") = TextBox3.Text If OptionButton1.Value = True Then Range(""E3"") = OptionButton1.Caption Else Range(""E3"") = OptionButton2.Value End If Range(""F3"") = TextBox4.Text  End Sub  Private Sub UserForm_Activate() ListBox1.List = Array(""A"", ""B"", ""C"") ListBox1.SetFocus End Sub For greater details you can visit familycomputerclub.com.

Are you a beginner, this video is for you, which will help you to go step by step to understand how #pivottables are created in excel.  Basic function which all should know especially data analyst for analyzing data.  A #pivot table is a table of statistics that summarizes the data of a more extensive table (such as from a #database, #spreadsheet, or #business intelligence program). This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the #pivot table groups together in a meaningful way.  Pivot tables are a technique in data processing. They arrange and rearrange (or ""pivot"") statistics in order to draw attention to useful information. This leads to finding figures and facts quickly making them integral to data #analysis. This ultimately leads to helping businesses or individuals make educated decisions.  Microsoft Excel is a powerful spreadsheet program that can cater to all of your needs. This app has all the functions you need to record, organize, and store numeric data. It can even be customized according to your preference for data analysis.

Time Stamps 00:00 How To Properly Import Data to Excel 01:16 How To Use Text to Columns in Excel 03:27 How To Import Data from CSV / TXT files to Excel 09:52 How To Import Data from The Web to Excel  Excel has various tools that can help you easily clean up your raw data for further analysis. Apart from using formulas and formatting, there are two useful Excel features that let you easily clean up. One method is text to columns feature and the other to import external data.  The Get External Data tool can be used to import and analyse data from other systems. This tool is also useful for importing data to run your dashboards or do further analysis using pivot tables, etc. Usually you can get data extracts from any system (e.g. “.dat” or “.csv” from Oracle, “.xml” files from SAP, etc.). These can be imported into Excel.   Importing External Data also gives you control over the decimals and thousand separator, especially if you’re dealing with international companies. In the US, the decimal is dot and the comma is a thousand separator and in most European countries it’s the other way round, where the comma is a decimal and the dot a thousand separator. It’s always safest to Import it properly with the Excel Data Import wizard!  After importing press Ctrl + T to create a table out of it. You can create a pivot table off this one, and when you do, even if you add more data to it, the pivot reflects the new data.  Importing Data from the Web / Internet into Excel – creating web queries that refresh automatically:  In Excel you can also import data directly from the web. You basically create a web query which you set to refresh automatically based on your preference.    ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/  ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/  EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/  Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593  GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U  More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani  Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani  Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

As Octoparse simulates human interaction with a webpage, it allows you to pull all the information you see on any website, such as Twitter. For example, you can easily extract Tweets of a handler, tweets containing certain hashtags, or posted within a specific time frame, etc.   All you need to do is to grab the URL of your target webpage and paste it into Octoparse built-in browser. Within a few point-and-clicks, you will be able to create a crawler from scratch by yourself. When the extraction is completed, you can export the data into Excel sheets, CSV, HTML, SQL, or you can stream it into your database in real-time via Octoparse APIs.   Step 1: Input the URL and build a pagination 1:24 Twitter applies “Infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to first scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.  Step 2: Build a loop item to extract the data 2:28 Make sure you go into the action setting of the “extract data” step. Click on the handler, and click “extract the text of the selected element”. Repeat this action to get all the data fields you want.  Step 3: Modify the pagination setting and execute the crawler 4:03 As we want Twitter to load the content fully before the bot extracts it, let’s set up the AJAX time out as 5 seconds, to give Twitter 5 seconds to load after each scroll.   Then, set up both the scroll repeats and the wait time as 2 to make sure that Twitter loads the content successfully. Now, for each scroll, Octoparse will scroll down for 2 screens, and each screen will take 2 seconds.   Head back to the loop item setting to edit the loop time to 20. This means that the bot will repeat the scrolling for 20 times.

That's called mental age. Do you wanna know yours? Lucky for you, Bright Side put together a simple test that will help you figure out if you're a carefree child, an old and wise sage or just exactly as mentally âoldâ as you are. Just answer our questions, write down your points for every answer, add them all up and get your results! But enough talking, let's begin!   If you got 7-12 points, mentally you're just under 20 years old. It doesn't matter what your passport says â youâre aÂ carefree teenager atÂ heart! If you're way older than 20, congratulations â you've managed to carry this constant feeling of enthusiasm and love for life through all these years. Keep shining!  If your result is 13â20Â points, you are 20â29 years old.Â You are active, creative, and full ofÂ life, but you can already call yourself anÂ adult. Childhood and teenage years are over, but you took the best from them and left all the unnecessary stuff behind. It doesn't mean that you're not having fun though â your life is just as exciting as it was.  If all of your points added up to 21â28Â points, your mental age is 30â39 years.Â Youâre still active and curious about new things and ideas, but you are already responsible and thoughtful. If you think about it, that's the perfect balance between the children's joy for life and adults' independence. The golden mean at its best!   If your total number of points is 29â35, you are 40â49 years old.Â You're mature and experienced, and you know exactly how toÂ live your life. You have no time for nonsense â you're determined and hardworking. You know what you want and how to get it. Continue to be a true inspiration for everyone around!  36â40Â points mean that your mental age is over 50Â years. And that's not a bad thing at all! On the contrary, you are wise and calm. You get what life is all about, and you highly appreciate comfort. You're the person everyone goes for advice, plus you can always be trusted. These are some rare qualities today, so your friends must protect you at all costs.  SoÂ whatâs your mental age and how close isÂ itÂ toÂ your real age?  #colortest #guessage #mentalage  Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our Social Media:  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/  SMART Youtube: https://goo.gl/JTfP6L  5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC  Have you ever seen a talking slime?

It looks like common sense isnât so common because according to research, 90% of adults get these questions wrong. Yet kids do just fine. Thatâs because grown-ups overcomplicate things while children use their common sense and don't overthink. So follow their lead and let's start!  1. Which word would you use if you needed to describe a person who doesn't have all their fingers on one hand?  2. If a plane crashes right on the border between Canada and the United States, where should they bury the survivors?  3. Imagine that youâve just entered a pitch black room. Thereâs an oil lamp, a newspaper, and some kindling wood inside the room, but you have only one match. You have to make a tough choice: what will you light first?  4. Mrs. Browny, despite her name, loves the color pink. Her bungalow is decorated entirely in the bubblegum color: pink carpet, furniture, curtains, even the walls are pink. So what color do you imagine the stairs are? 5. 5. One day a man got caught in the pouring rain. Unfortunately, he had no umbrella or hat or anything else he could use to stay dry. Yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How so?  6. How can it be that every single person in a plane crash died, but two people survived?  7. Time for a tricky one so be very attentive: what do you sleep on, sit on, and brush your teeth with? 8. In some months there are 31 days, in others there are 30. But how many months have 28 days? 9. A man dressed in all black from head to toe was walking in the middle of the road. All of a sudden, a huge black car with its headlights off came around the corner and screeched to a halt not to hit him. How on Earth did the driver of the car see the man in black?  10. There were three highly important rooms in the house of an extremely important man. One room was filled with valuable secret documents, the second one was full of money, and in the third room, the man kept expensive jewelry. But one day an arsonist set the house on fire and all the highly important rooms burst into flames. Which of the rooms did the police start to extinguish the fire first and foremost?  11. Whatâs the biggest problem with snow boots?  12. How do you put a giraffe in a refrigerator? 13. Now, how do you put an elephant in a fridge? 14. Noah builds one more ark and invites all the worldâs animals to join him. Every single animal gets onboard, except for one. What animal doesn't board the ark?  15. Youâre hiking in the wilderness when you come upon a river. You have to cross it, but you know that crocodiles dwell in rivers there. How can you reach the opposite side without becoming a crocodileâs dinner?

That fancy word means 3 types of cone cells help them see and recognize colors. Each of those types is responsible for distinguishing between 100 shades. - Colorblind people are limited to 10,000 shades with 2 cone cell types. The same is true for mammals like dogs and monkeys, for example. - And if you ask anyone to name the most basic and common colors, theyâll most likely go with green, red, white, black, and blue. However, according to philologists, humans didnât recognize the color blue until modern times! - Back in 2006, Jules Davidoff, a psychologist from Goldsmiths, University of London, studied the topic and worked with the Himba tribe from Namibia. The Himba donât have a word for blue.

But did you know that what you see first in such an image can speak volumes about your personality? You might see one thing in the image, yet someone else will try to convince you that itâs another. And thatâs exactly why optical illusions can be like a personality test.  Do you wanna know yourself on a whole new level? Then watch our new video! The test is pretty simple. As soon as you see the image, make note of what popped out at you first. Depending on what you saw immediately, youâll get a description of some attribute to your personality. Here we go!

Most people see a frog right away. If this is about you, then you have a straightforward personality. Those whose attention is first drawn to the horse are thoughtful individuals. - #2. If the first thing that caught your eye was three big grey bears, you have an analytical way of thinking. If you saw mountains first and only then recognized that they looked like bears, your style of thinking is intuitive. - #3. In this picture, most people immediately notice a couple of squirrels sitting on a tree branch. These are the types of individuals who can see the big picture effortlessly. If the face was the first thing you saw in the picture, congrats! You're a unique individual with outstanding observational skills. - #4. You're a person who prefers to concentrate on the big picture if the first thing you spotted in this image was a man holding a pair of binoculars. If you instantly saw a car, your co-workers and friends must appreciate your ability to notice fine details. - #5. If the first thing you paid attention to was a couple looking at each other, then you're a romantic at heart. If your attention was instantly drawn to a tree, you're the type who occasionally needs to be on their own. - #6. If you're one of those who notice the face of a young woman, you're always aware of your surroundings. If you saw only flowers in this image, you probably really love nature. - #7. If you spotted a mouse first, you're an optimist. You prefer to look for advantages in every situation. If you saw a cat as soon as you glanced at this picture, you're a realistic person. - #8. If you noticed a woman looking out the window first, you may tend to overlook dangers. You might even risk your life without realizing it! Was it a skull that you noticed first? If so, then you're a realist rather than an idealist. - #9. If the first thing your eyes landed on was a man playing the sax, then you're left-brained. This means that your forte is analytical thinking. If you first noticed the face of a woman, you're a right-brained individual. - #10. If the first animal you saw was a squirrel, this means that the left side of your brain is more developed. If you noticed a duck, the right hemisphere of your brain is dominant. - #11. If you noticed a seal in this picture, your attention to details is astonishing. You're a highly intuitive person if the first thing you saw in the picture was a donkey.

Here are 10 extremely difficult choices you will ever have to make! Throughout our lives, we are constantly bombarded with major choices. Our decisions determine your future and define you and shape your personality. In this video, Bright Side offers you to make 10 extremely difficult choices. At the end of the video, weâll tell what kind of person you are!   TEST RULES There are only two possible answers to each question. You need to choose between option A and option B. As youâre taking the test, keep track of how many times you chose A or B because youâll need these totals at the end of the video to find out your results. Youâll only have 5 seconds to think about each question before we give the explanation. Donât think too long, and go with your gut; youâll get the most accurate results that way!  WOULD YOU RATHER... ...be the smartest person or the most charming? 1:17 ...you rather always have to tell the truth or lie? 1:47 ...never have Internet or never take an airplane? 2:21 ...find true love or win a million dollars? 3:04 ...never be able to speak or have to say everything on your mind? 3:28 ...have a photographic memory or be able to forget anything you want? 4:09 ...never have sex again or never eat your favorite food? 4:50 ...be the only person to live a happy life or be the only person to live an unhappy life? 5:19 ...be the first person to discover an inhabitable planet or inventor of a drug that cures a deadly disease? 5:58 ...be poor but able to help people or get incredibly rich by hurting other people? 6:38  SUMMARY If you chose A 1 to 3 times, youâre a pretty selfish person. Very few people would like to work with you on a team. Itâs not that bad though; it just means that you prefer fighting for yourself to get exactly what you want.   If you chose option A 4 to 6 times, it means that youâre moderately selfish. Youâre like the Goldilocks of this list: not too much, not too little, just right. Pretty much most people would fall into this category. You can be selfish when you need to be.  If you chose option A 7 to 10 times, youâre the type of person who is always ready to sacrifice your own interests for someone else.   What results did you get? Do you agree with them?

So get ready to check your visual perception with this fun challenge!   Some of these illusions were interpreted a long time ago, while others will challenge your brain and still wonât give a logical explanation.

And depending on what you see first, it can come off as a little creepy. - If you found 10 faces hidden among the branches, then you're an extremely observant individual. Some say that these faces are actually those of famous public figures! - This gorgeous lady must be a ballerina. Otherwise, how does she keep rotating like that, with that much grace? But, we are here not to discuss her artistic skills. - The name of this illusion was inspired by a tiled wall of a cafĂŠ in Bristol. But I will tell you no more for now. Can you tell if the dark lines are parallel to each other or inclined? - The impossible triangle, also known as Penrose Triangle is called so because it could never exist in reality. If it did exist, it would be absolutely contrary to the rules of Euclidean geometry. - What makes the bicycle move? Obviously, the fact that the spokes in its wheels are rotating. Nah, it canât be that easy when it comes to optical illusions. - Itâs a Rubikâs cube! This optical illusion is based on anamorphosis. It is a form of perspective. - You canât play any chess with this board because itâs moving all over the place. Or is it? You have 15 seconds to decide if the lines are rotating. - Can you tell whatâs wrong with Steve Buscemi? I mean I hope Steve is perfectly fine, but can you tell whatâs wrong with the second picture? - Look at this black square crisscrossed with perpendicular white lines. The white dots situated at the intersections of the grid shift their color from white to gray and back. - It takes one large box and one little box and some magic to make this illusion possible. How is it possible for the little box to be outside, inside and part of the large box at the same time?

In case you spend tons of time looking at your smartphone, tablet, computer, or TV screen, you arenât doing your eyes any good, youâre seriously damaging them. If we are being completely blunt, your eyes strain too much, they get tired too quickly, and your eyesight drops.   TIMESTAMPS ""Feed"" your eyes properly. 0:57 Make some lifestyle changes. 3:05 Do special exercises to train your eyes. 6:13 Bonus: products that can make your eyes change their color 8:59  Poor eyesight, in turn, creates a whole bunch of different problems, from choosing eyeglasses and contact lenses to saving money for an expensive surgery. Itâs really important to care about your vision using some natural ways to improve it. In this video, you'll get to know about some of them. If you include in your diet onions, garlic, and caper, you will enrich your diet with lecithin, sulfur, and cysteine. This will prevent the lenses of your eyes from getting cataracts. Omega-3 fatty acids (in the amount of 1,000 mg per day) will help you to avoid dry eyes and macular degeneration. That's why mackerel, herring, tuna, salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds should be frequent ingredients in your diet. If you can't get any seafood, buying fish oil supplements will be a good alternative. Dark leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, carrots, and pumpkin contain beta-carotene, zeaxanthin, and lutein. These elements protect your eyes from being damaged by the sun.  Try to use your computer as little as possible. Of course, it's easier said than done if your work is tightly connected to this device. Even so, there are some ways to reduce the negative impact of staring at the computer screen all day long. Implement a 20-20-20 rule to your working routine. According to this rule, you should look at something situated 20 feet away from you for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Don't forget to blink, this way you'll produce tears. They're necessary to refresh and moisten your eyes. Make the font size larger and the screen brighter and more contrast. This will help you to read and browse easier. Your monitor should be directly in front of you. Its screen is to be located a bit below your eye level.  Try near and far focusing exercise to significantly strengthen your eye muscles.You can do this exercise in a sitting or standing position, it doesn't matter. Choose an object 10-20 feet away from you and focus on it. Stay like this for 10-15 seconds. Then refocus your eyes on your thumb that is 10 inches away from your face. Stay concentrated for 10-15 seconds.   Music:  Boo Boogie - Dougie Wood Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (by Mozart) -Mozart Standing Here - Silent Partner Sabor Moreno -Quincas Moreira https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music  SUMMARY -Diet rich in vegetables and fruit, low in fatty foods and sugar that your eyes demand is, actually, beneficial for your whole body. As for crab, turkey, and oysters, they contain zinc and copper. Zinc helps to produce an eye-protecting pigment melanin. Copper prevents the development of age-related macular degeneration.  -Also, when you work or study, keep a shaded lamp on the desk. Improve the quality of the air in your office and at home. First and foremost, get an air humidifier. Quit smoking. Control your weight.  -Start with some eye massage and pencil push-ups. You can also try near and far focusing exercise, drawing figure ""eight"" with your eyes, and directional exercises.  -Some people think that it's possible to lighten the color of your eyes with the help of such products as honey, spinach, ginger, chamomile tea, and so one. Presumably, your eyes will get brighter in just 2 weeks.

Nowadays, there are lots of gadgets around us. We stare at our computers and mobile phones all day, every day, and of course this affects our vision. How many people feel their eyes aching at the end of the day, or have blurry vision and eye dryness? All of these symptoms can indicate ophthalmic problems.There are a variety of vision deficiencies: colorblindness, near- and farsightedness, and astigmatism are the most common problems. Sometimes, a person doesnât even know they have these issues â they just think that everyone sees this way.  So do you wanna find out exactly how good your vision is and what you can do to improve it? We have a little test for you. You have to complete 9 simple tasks. Donât forget to add one point to your score for every correct answer. Let's start!  TIMESTAMPS:  Question #1 0:54 Question #2 1:28 Question #3 2:05 Question #4 2:44 Question #5 3:15 Question #6 3:49 Question #7 4:26 Question #8 5:01 Question #9 5:36 Exercise #1 6:55 Exercise #2 7:23 Exercise #3 8:02 Exercise #4 8:35 Exercise #5 9:13  #goodeyesight #eyemassage #eyeproblems  Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/   SUMMARY:  - It's always better to gradually increase the difficulty of the exercises, so make sure to start with simple blinking! Keep your eyes closed for about a second, and then open them. Do this at least 20 times, and then move on to the next exercise! - Focusing on a certain side will help your eye muscles become stronger and ensure their good work. Don't overdo it, though! Performing this exercise once or twice a day is more than enough to keep your eyes healthy. - You can do the eye bounce exercise while standing up, sitting, or even lying down! All you have to do is move your eyes up and down quickly about 10 times. When youâre done, rest for about a minute. Then repeat the exercise but with your eyes closed this time. - This exercise is kinda self-explanatory: You have to sit straight, look in front of you, and trace a path as if you're drawing a giant 8 with your eyes on the wall in front of you. Don't cheat by moving your head â only your eyes should work here. Repeat this exercise about 5 times, and then go on with your day! - Make sure youâre sitting straight, and tilt your head back a little bit. In this position, close your eyes, and place your index and middle fingers on your eyelids. Move the fingers of your right hand in a counterclockwise direction and the fingers of your left hand in a clockwise direction. Do this for about a minute, change directions, and repeat for one more minute.

One morning, you find out that you're almost out of water. You can get more water from one of 4 sources: a juicy cactus, a pond with salty sea water, a clear still lake, or a silty stream. What source of water will you choose to fill your filter water bottle with? - A truck, a man riding a horse, and a motorcycle are waiting on the road for the green light. Suddenly, the truck driver drops his cell phone on the horn. The loud noise scares the horse, and it bites the motorcyclist's ear. The man unwittingly moves his motorcycle and causes an accident. But which person actually broke the law? - Youâre lost in a forest. It's getting dark, and very soon wild animals will start their hunt.  There are 4 roads you can choose from: the North, South, West, and East. Choose your way.  - A psycho caught you and let you choose where youâd have to stay on your own for the following three weeks. He gave you three options: a desert full of cacti; a sunny field with flowers, a banana, and a glass of water; and a beach under stormy skies, surrounded by sharp cliffs, and hit by high waves. Where do you have the best chances to survive?  - One night, you find yourself stuck in an old spooky castle. You hear someone chasing after you, and you run faster and faster; but suddenly - a dead end! However, as your eyes adjust, you notice three doors in the wall. But behind each door, there are some horrifying creatures. Which door should you open to have a chance to survive? - Mark and James played in the attic where it was dark and dirty. But when they came down, only Mark's face was covered in dust, while James's face was miraculously clean. However, it was James who went and washed his face. Why?  - A treasure hunter got lost in a forest. But after heâd been walking for some time, he noticed a crossroad with a big stone in the middle. There was a note on this stone which read, ""4+no5."" Can you help the treasure hunter to decipher the code?  - You got kidnapped and locked in a stone house. However, there are 4 doors you can escape through. Is there a way to escape? - One day, John was caught by a maniac and thrown into a 20-ft-deep pit. He looked around and noticed that on the bottom of the pit, there was a 6-ft-long rope, a 4-ft-tall wooden barrel, and a 3-ft-tall metal safe. John himself was 6 ft tall. How could he use these objects to get out of the pit alive? - Look at the picture. Ten minutes before it was taken, someone from this photo had stolen all the money from the cafe on the beach. However, all these people claim that none of them had visited the cafe in the last 10 minutes. Whoâs the thief? - Matt escaped from prison by digging a long tunnel in the floor of his cell. Heâd been crawling through the underground tunnel for 3 hours, when he saw that the main tunnel divided into three smaller ones. But the first one was on fire, and the second tunnel was home to a nest of venomous snakes. The third tunnel was set with explosives. How can Matt escape?

Itâs not very big, but itâs very hairy. You might think that because itâs hairy, itâs tender to touch, but donât let it fool you. In fact, if you touch the hairs, they will penetrate your skin and sting you. According to the experience of other people, the pain is unimaginably bad, so stay away from this caterpillar if you can. However, if you got stung, doctors recommend washing the area of the bite. Use water and soap, but be very careful not to press the spot â because this will make the poison spread faster. After you finish washing the bite, put some ice to reduce the pain. If the pain doesnât go away within the next 30 minutes or so, go to the hospital immediately.

Are you a superhuman or worse than average? Check it out!  The older we get, the harder it becomes for us to hear high-frequency sounds. The worse it gets, the fewer chances you have of hearing the birds sing, the beeping of your microwave, and even consonants like s,h or f. You donât want that to happen to you, right? Do you have any reasons to worry about it? How can you test your ears? Here's a simple, but 100 % accurate test you can take, and we are going to run it in a few moments. When itâs done, we are going to share some fun facts on hearing we bet you didnât know.  What should you do? Put on your headphones. Make sure you are in a quiet place, with no background noises.  TIMESTAMPS Test description 0:35 Best hearing test ever 2:15 Results 3:05 10 fun facts about hearing 3:46  SUMMARY How many of you turned out to be superhumans who could catch the sound at 150? Anyone? Oh, yours was 120? Thatâs pretty amazing, too. 110? That is also better than the average result. Well done! Now, let us see how many of us hear have average or better than average hearing.  If your results are not so good, do not panic. Your age influences your ability to hear high frequencies, remember? If itâs really bad, try it again. Maybe the sound was off on your computer. If you are perfectly sure itâs not the computer to blame, you might want to see a doctor to figure out whatâs wrong.

We are used to believing what we see because we are sure that nobody can trick our eyes. But some pictures can make us see things that arenât there. Itâs because we donât see with our eyes, we see with our brain. And the brain can easily be tricked.   You might see one thing in the image, yet someone else will try to convince you that itâs another. And thatâs exactly why optical illusions can be like a personality test.   The test is pretty simple. As soon as you see the image, make note of what popped out at you first. Depending on what you saw immediately, youâll get a description of some attribute to your personality. Here we go!  TIMESTAMPS:  Optical illusion #1 1:14 Optical illusion #2 1:54 Optical illusion #3 2:45 Optical illusion #4 3:43 Optical illusion #5 4:32 Optical illusion #6 5:47 Optical illusion #7 6:36 Optical illusion #8 7:34 Optical illusion #9 8:17 Optical illusion #10 9:13  #opticalillusion #personalitytest  Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/   Mooney Face Picture. An example of the face photographs used by the cognitive psychologist Craig Mooney: By Adapted from Le Cerveau Ă  tous les niveaux, http://www.lecerveau.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_02/a_02_p/a_02_p_vis/a_02_p_vis.html, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1916754 Animation is created by Bright Side.  SUMMARY:  - #1 Did you see a tree first thing off the bat? If so, you tend to pay a bit too much attention to details. On the bright side, youâre really great at reading other peopleâs moods. - #2 If you canât help but see a duck, then youâre probably right-brained, meaning you're more of an artistic and creative type. You have a well-developed intuition and a rich imagination. - #3 If it was a candlestick that drew your attention first, youâre great at seeing the big picture and donât get lost in all the details. Your critical thinking skills are also pretty sharp. - #4 Do you immediately see a young woman in a fancy hat and fur coat looking away from the viewer? Then you have a joyful and optimistic personality. You can be a little too impulsive, though, living your best life in the moment and allâŚ - #5 Did you see a car in this picture? If so, you value your freedom. You prefer to move at your own speed and have things go according to your own plan. Your ability to notice finite details fascinates many. - #6 If you immediately saw a beautiful young woman, then the right hemisphere of your brain is developed better than the left one. Again, this means that youâre a creative and artistic person. - #7 Is that big crocodile jumping out at you? Then youâre probably a pretty practical individual. Cautious and careful, you prefer to avoid any risk-taking. From time to time, you concentrate more on the negative aspects of life instead of its bright sides. - #8 Most people notice a dog's tail and hind leg in this picture. If you're one of them, you always try to look for original decisions to your problems. You use not only your logical thinking but also a creative approach.  - #9 For those who see two crocodiles touching noses, this means that you always try to be in control of every situation in your life. You'd rather be in charge than obey orders. - #10 If the first thing you saw in this picture was a dark-haired woman sitting on the ground, then you have sharp observational skills and an eye for detail. Also, you're a reserved and introverted person.

Well, stay tuned - because I’m going to show you how to get this data in a few minutes using only your web browser.  Now, maybe you’ve seen my other videos on where I walk you through how to use the official Twitter API to collect data. However, a lot of you have complained to me about the Twitter API approval process, telling me they never get back to you, reject your application for no reason, or even suspend your app and never. even. respond. to your appeal after waiting for 2 months with absolutely no response.  And the sad thing is, most of these complaints I get are mostly from students just looking to get a little bit of targeted data for a school assignment or for research purposes.  I mean really Twitter? Really!? If only there were a social media platform I could voice my frustration on…  Well, the good news is that you don’t need to use the Twitter API to scrape reasonable amounts of Twitter data. See, when you browse around Twitter, you’ll notice a lot of these scrolling and pagination requests are happening dynamically, which means they’re sending structured data to our browser as we scroll through Twitter, in full accordance with their Terms of Service.  So if we can then access this data they sent to our browser after we’re done browsing Twitter, we’ll be good and have a copy of the Twitter data they sent to us during our browser session.  We can easily do this using a little known feature in web browsers known as a HAR file export… let me show you.  We just go to Twitter and then right click anywhere on the page and hit “Inspect” to open up developer tools. This will now “record” our web traffic during our Twitter session, so we can easily export a copy of the data that Twitter sends to us.  So let’s try a few things, like scraping tweets by hashtag - I just enter my hashtag in the search bar and scroll through all the tweets. When I’m done, I then go to the “Network” tab and hit “Export HAR…” to save a HAR file with the Tweets to my computer.  Ok, so now how do we get the data from the HAR file? How do we even open a HAR file? Well I’ve built a free tool I have linked to in the description: https://stevesie.com/har-file-web-scraper that will do this for you. You simply drag and drop the HAR file into your browser and it will process it for FREE, presenting you back with the raw JSON data from Twitter containing the tweets we just saw.  We can even search through the data to jump to the specific JSON response with your search term. And I can download each request here for FREE, seeing the raw JSON here. I can see the text of the Tweet, timestamp, mentions, images, videos, etc…  Now what if I need the data in a more usable format and combined together… like I ideally want all of the Tweets we looked at combined into a single CSV file instead of all these individual JSON files.  Well for premium Stevesie users, they’ll see this parse button here at the top of the request group. This will automagically parse the combined JSON responses together and convert it into “collections” which I can then download as CSV files containing all the Tweets here.  I can see all the combined Tweet contents, timestamps, hashtags, images, etc… all in one CSV file.  This approach should work with a lot of other Twitter data too - it looks like we just need to keep poking around the site and the free HAR File Web Scraper will help us access the raw data.  Now you may be asking, is this legal? Well keep in mind we legally used Twitter, right? The only thing we did differently was to record the network traffic that Twitter sent to our computer and then post-processed that logged data in a more usable format, like CSV format.  The only legal issue you could face here is if you do something not-so-nice with the data after scraping it - that’s where 9 / 10 of legal problems arise from when it comes to data scraping. E.g. if you re-publish the data somewhere else without permission, that would be bad. If you just want to use the data privately… that’s probably fine.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter API restrictions, developer terms, etc… they seem much more concerned with you disclosing any sensitive data, so be sure to read up on what you can re-publish to protect other Twitter users’ privacy.";"UCArmutk8nAbYQdaYzgqKOwA";"Stevesie Data"

Official Instagram API allow you to access your own follower and following count but you cannot access other profile details with that.  But if you open any Instagram profile you can see those details and if you try to scrape you'll be prompted with captcha or block request. That's why we rely on the third-party API(http://bit.ly/freescraperAPIkey) which simulate like a real user, handle captcha and continuously rotate IPs.  This Google sheet connected to the third party and scrape the below details  1) Instagram Profile Name 2) Verified Badge 3) Post count 4) Exact Follower count 5) Round off Follower count 6) Following count  You need to get the API key and put it on the setting tab B1.

How do you communicate the data analysis process to ensure the transparency of the data reduction and transformation process? How do you ensure credibility of the findings as you communicate the results? What is the role of NVivo Outputs (i.e. diagrams and tables) in communicating the results?

Check the course landing page for more info.  You'd like to bring data from a web page into Excel? Instead of copying and pasting, use ""Get and Transform"" (Power Query) from the ""Data"" tab. This way you can import website data properly into Excel. Once you create a web query you can automatically get the latest data in Excel. You just have to refresh your query and update the query settings so it runs a refresh at specific intervals defined by you.   Getting data from a web page has never been easier. Just Open Excel, go to the ""Data"" tab and click on ""From Web"". Enter the web address of the external page you'd like to import. Power Query opens and tries to find the html tables on that web page. Select the correct table and transform your data. This step gives you the ability to customize your output. You can for example, fill in the blanks by automatically copying down the top values. You can remove the columns you don't need and clean up the data. Once done, you can view the data in an Excel table, as an Excel Pivot Table or create a connection to the query.  Note: Importing web data with Power Query this way requires the tables on the web pages to be in HTML format - otherwise they're not recognized in the Navigator view.   Example 1- Importing crude oil spot prices to Excel: 01:15 Example 2 - Getting the latest weather data into Excel: 04:59 Bonus - using emojis in Power Query: 07:25  ______ Check out _______  Frédéric Le Guen's blog post on adding emojis to your reports: https://www.excel-exercise.com/add-emojis-to-your-charts-formulas/  Oz's video - Emojis, Excel, Power Query & Dynamic Arrays: https://youtu.be/c-tnA1zfrzs  ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook (scroll to the bottom of the blog post): https://www.xelplus.com/import-data-from-web-to-excel/  Check out the Power Query Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyyKV86N7i0q9TfYNN8bBjX-  ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/  ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/  EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/  Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593  GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U  More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani  Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani  Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Check the course landing page for more info.  Prepare to be amazed! This is the easiest way to combine multiple Excel files from a folder into one Workbook and create a table or a a pivot table report based on the consolidated data.  Many of us send out templates to colleagues and are later faced with the challenge to somehow consolidate multiple Excel files. To append the data into a single Excel workbook can be quite a troublesome and lengthy process.   Sure, a solution for this has always been Excel VBA. But learning VBA takes time and it can be too difficult for a lot Excel users.   In this tutorial, I'll show you a much easier approach! We'll use Excel Get and Transform aka Power Query to combine data from multiple Excel workbooks. We will directly connect to a folder that contains the files and use the feature Combine Files in Power Query. Any time you drop an Excel file in that folder, the data will be appended and consolidated with the rest. You can then create one Excel table for the appended data or create a pivot table from the multiple Excel files.   The best part about using Power Query to merge data from Excel files is that you don't need to write any code! You just need to click a few buttons to append the data from the files.

For details you can visit our website: http://www.exceltrainingvideos.com/complete-automation-of-getting-web-page-data-into-excel-worksheet-using-vba/ In this video we show the complete automation of how to get data into an Excel worksheet using VBA. 1. We first study the website and find out the elements we'll need to access a form and the subsequent results. When you study the web page's HTML source code you'll note that the actual results are wrapped up in DIV containers.  2. Next we write the VBA code We use the getElementById method to get a reference to a single object and the getElementsByTagName method to get a collection of all the elements. Next we loop through all the elements and get the text properties or data ('innertext') of all the elements we wish to have. Our code instantiates our web browser (Internet Explorer) and navigates to the URL of our choice and then helps to get or extract the data using events. We also ensure that the code is placed in appropriate columns and rows so that any further analysis is made easy. Finally we use a recorded macro to format the data to make it more presentable to the human eye.

The techniques apply to all modern versions of Excel (Excel 2013, 2016, 2019, and Excel 365 that is part of Office 365). These tips don’t require VBA, plug-ins, or add-ins so you can apply them right away.  Here are the Excel charting tips and tricks in this video (with the time code for that tip in the video):  Introduction screen (0:00) A shortcut key to access the format pane (0:04) Select any data series or point if you can’t click on it (1:39) Quickly filter the series and/or categories shown on a chart (3:04) Three ways to make gridlines less prominent so the data is the focus (5:35) Two-level category labels to make a crowded axis clearer (7:23) Use a data label on a single point to replace the legend in a line graph (9:10) Use colored text in the chart title to replace the legend in a column graph (12:01) Use a cell as the chart or axis title to make updating easier (13:36) Create custom formatted data labels that include text and symbols (16:10) Use custom number formatting to add indicators to data labels (19:43) Add the % change above a pair of related columns (22:57) Add explanations on a column or line chart without using a text box (27:55) How to hide data points or data labels you don’t want the viewer to see (31:20) Automatically label the minimum and maximum values on a line graph (34:04) Add a rolling average line to a column chart and have it update automatically (36:56) Add the change % from a previous period to the end of the bars in a bar chart (40:54) Add direction indicators for the change % at the end of bars in a bar chart (44:50) Create a column of text for explanations on the right side of a bar chart (49:52) Break a line graph into actual and estimated segments (54:05) Keep a line continuous when there is missing data (55:59) Compare actual to both last year and budget using dotted lines on a column chart (57:46) Visually show how segments add to a total (1:02:33) Show a range of possible values around an expected line on a line graph (1:05:14) Create a column chart where the colors are set by the values (1:07:25) The best way to copy a chart so it can be used for another region, department, or time period (1:12:28)  These tips and tricks are just a small part of what I share in my customized workshops for business professionals where I show them how to create clear visual messages of financial data.

Check the course landing page for more info.  You'd like to bring data from a web page into Excel? Instead of copying and pasting, use ""Get and Transform"" (Power Query) from the ""Data"" tab. This way you can import website data properly into Excel. Once you create a web query you can automatically get the latest data in Excel. You just have to refresh your query and update the query settings so it runs a refresh at specific intervals defined by you.   Getting data from a web page has never been easier. Just Open Excel, go to the ""Data"" tab and click on ""From Web"". Enter the web address of the external page you'd like to import. Power Query opens and tries to find the html tables on that web page. Select the correct table and transform your data. This step gives you the ability to customize your output. You can for example, fill in the blanks by automatically copying down the top values. You can remove the columns you don't need and clean up the data. Once done, you can view the data in an Excel table, as an Excel Pivot Table or create a connection to the query.  Note: Importing web data with Power Query this way requires the tables on the web pages to be in HTML format - otherwise they're not recognized in the Navigator view.

Time Stamps 00:00 How To Properly Import Data to Excel 01:16 How To Use Text to Columns in Excel 03:27 How To Import Data from CSV / TXT files to Excel 09:52 How To Import Data from The Web to Excel  Excel has various tools that can help you easily clean up your raw data for further analysis. Apart from using formulas and formatting, there are two useful Excel features that let you easily clean up. One method is text to columns feature and the other to import external data.  The Get External Data tool can be used to import and analyse data from other systems. This tool is also useful for importing data to run your dashboards or do further analysis using pivot tables, etc. Usually you can get data extracts from any system (e.g. “.dat” or “.csv” from Oracle, “.xml” files from SAP, etc.). These can be imported into Excel.   Importing External Data also gives you control over the decimals and thousand separator, especially if you’re dealing with international companies. In the US, the decimal is dot and the comma is a thousand separator and in most European countries it’s the other way round, where the comma is a decimal and the dot a thousand separator. It’s always safest to Import it properly with the Excel Data Import wizard!  After importing press Ctrl + T to create a table out of it. You can create a pivot table off this one, and when you do, even if you add more data to it, the pivot reflects the new data.  Importing Data from the Web / Internet into Excel – creating web queries that refresh automatically:  In Excel you can also import data directly from the web. You basically create a web query which you set to refresh automatically based on your preference.    ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/  ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/  EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/  Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593  GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U  More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani  Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani  Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

In this advanced excel tutorial I will show you how to get live data from web page into excel. Live data means you’ll get updated data whenever the site changes its data. Not only this, you’ll not even have to open the website. This is a built-in feature of Microsoft excel and I am using excel 2019 for the demonstration. You’ll be able to use this from excel 10 version and above.   Now follow the instruction to import data from website to excel. Step 1: Click on “Data” Tab Step 2: Click on “From Web” to import data from web to excel. Step 3: Paste the “Web Url” to pull data from a website into excel inside the address bar. Step 4: Click on “Go”.  Step 5: If that site requires login then login here and excel will pull data from website with login Step 6: Click on “Option” Step 7: Select “Use the same import setting for the entire selection” Step 8: Click on the arrow beside your data table to “Select” Step 9: Click on Import Step 10: Select the cell where you want the data and click ok.  Done. You’ve successfully imported data from a web page. If you need to extract data from website to excel automatically you can setup a timer to auto refresh. This will automate data scraping from websites into excel.

Step 1: Position your fingers on the keys Position your fingers on the keyboard. Put your left little finger on the ""A"" and your right little finger on the semicolon. Lay your fingers one at a time on each consecutive key and place your thumbs on the space bar.  Tip The F and J keys on most keyboards have small bumps to easily identify where your two pointer fingers should stay without having to look down.  Step 2: Learn the left hand keys Learn what fingers control which keys. The left index finger controls the F, G, R, T, 4, 5, V, and B. The left middle finger controls the D, E, 3, and C. The left ring finger controls the S, W, 2, and x. The left little finger controls the A, Q, 1, Z, and shift.  Step 3: Learn the right hand keys Learn what keys the fingers on the right hand type. The fingers on the right hand control the same pattern of keys as you learned on the left side.  Step 4: Use your thumb Press the space bar with your right thumb.  Step 5: Master the shift keys Master the shift keys with your little fingers. Press the shift key while simultaneously pressing the letter of choice to type a capital letter. If the letter is pressed by the right hand, use the left shift key, and vice versa.  Step 6: Sit up straight Sit up straight with both feet on the floor. Position your chair and keyboard so your arms are at a 90 degree angle and are parallel to your legs. Keep your elbows next to your body and your head straight.  Tip Try not to look down at the keys.  Step 7: Practice Practice typing. You can learn for free online by visiting websites with touch typing tutorials. Learning the art of typing will save you tons of time over the hunt and peck method.  Did You Know? The letters on old typewriters used to be listed alphabetically. In the late 1800s, Christopher Latham Sholes rearranged the keys to prevent jamming.";"UCSpVHeDGr9UbREhRca0qwsA";"Howcast"

Have you ever wanted to download embedded videos on website so you can watch it later?  Sometimes right click, ""save as"" just doesn't work.  If that's the case you need to go into the ""back end"" of the website and download the file through the code.  Don't worry, it's not hard.  Just watch the short video.  Here's a summary:  1. Use Google Chrome 2. Open the source code 3. Identify the video code 4. Open the video in a new page 5. View the source of the video 6. Download it!  Hope this helps!   I've also noticed that Vimeo doesn't work quite the same way.  If you can't find the URLs, try this method:  1. Open the first video page, then VIEW - DEVELOPER - VIEW SOURCE.    2. CTRL and F to show find window, then look for ""player.vimeo"" and get the link that way.  Make sure to copy the entire link from "" to "".    3. Then paste that in a new tab.    4. Then VIEW - DEVELOPER - VIEW SOURCE.    5.  CTRL and F to show find, then look for "".mp4"" and get the link that way.  Make sure to copy the entire link from "" to "" - go past the question mark  6. Paste into new tab.  7. Save as and you are done.  Oh, if you need any online, digital or mobile advertising done, head to over to my company http://wepromote.com.au  **TRANSCRIPTION**  Hi it’s James Mackay here.  What I am going to do today is to show you how to download embedded videos. This is something people ask me for help with all the time so I will explain this problem first and then I will show you how to do it.   So this is an embedded video. If you right click on this, it comes up with all this strange stuff, where you might be expecting “save video” but it doesn’t work like that.  This is the video that we want to download. We can’t right click SAVE AS.  There’s no FILE, SAVE AS or anything like that.   First thing you need to do is be using GOOGLE CHROME for your browser. Then you come over to this little menu option box here. You come down to more TOOLS, DEVELOPER TOOLS. You just click on that. This is the first step.   That brings up all of this code on the right hand side. You don’t have to edit it. You come up to the top left corner of the code section. Hit the SELECT AN ELEMENT in the page to inspect. It is also known as magnifying glass. Just like that the video goes blue and then you come back over to your video page. As you highlight different things here, it pops up in the code.   We come down to a video and we click on that and watch the code as it highlights this video in the code.   What we want is to find the URL because all videos have their own unique URL. Here is the URL because it is underlined which shows us this is a link a www. It is not a dot-com but that is a URL.  http://fast.wistia.net blah blah.  The URL goes up to the question mark and after that doesn’t count.   As you can see I cannot edit this. I can’t COPY or CUT PASTE in there. We need to right click and we go to EDIT AS HTML. That’s step three. The URL starts after HTTP colon slash slash so these are the slashes. It is just different sort of URL. We come up here and we highlight the whole lot up to the question mark like that. RIGHT CLICK AND COPY. We come up to here, we open new tab and we literally just PASTE AND GO and that’s going to paste in a URL and that starts to load our video.   What we have done now is isolated the video onto the page and got rid of the rest of the page. Now the next step: come up to VIEW, go down to DEVELOPER VIEW SOURCE. That brings up the source code only of the video so it is broken down to the next level. Then what we are doing is looking for a video file and  save a video file it is going to be a .mov .avi or .mp4.   Here is a .mp4 . We click on that and that should bring up a video file. There’s a video. What we have done is taken it from a URL up to a file name.  We can right click on this because it is not a webpage, it is an actual video file and we can SAVE AS VIDEO. Call it whatever you want, we call it James and saved to the desktop and boom you are done!   And that is how you SAVE AN EMBEDDED VIDEO.";"UCQwwLpY6TUyelp6vYM77KrQ";"James Mackay"

Well, stay tuned - because I’m going to show you how to get this data in a few minutes using only your web browser.  Now, maybe you’ve seen my other videos on where I walk you through how to use the official Twitter API to collect data. However, a lot of you have complained to me about the Twitter API approval process, telling me they never get back to you, reject your application for no reason, or even suspend your app and never. even. respond. to your appeal after waiting for 2 months with absolutely no response.  And the sad thing is, most of these complaints I get are mostly from students just looking to get a little bit of targeted data for a school assignment or for research purposes.  I mean really Twitter? Really!? If only there were a social media platform I could voice my frustration on…  Well, the good news is that you don’t need to use the Twitter API to scrape reasonable amounts of Twitter data. See, when you browse around Twitter, you’ll notice a lot of these scrolling and pagination requests are happening dynamically, which means they’re sending structured data to our browser as we scroll through Twitter, in full accordance with their Terms of Service.  So if we can then access this data they sent to our browser after we’re done browsing Twitter, we’ll be good and have a copy of the Twitter data they sent to us during our browser session.  We can easily do this using a little known feature in web browsers known as a HAR file export… let me show you.  We just go to Twitter and then right click anywhere on the page and hit “Inspect” to open up developer tools. This will now “record” our web traffic during our Twitter session, so we can easily export a copy of the data that Twitter sends to us.  So let’s try a few things, like scraping tweets by hashtag - I just enter my hashtag in the search bar and scroll through all the tweets. When I’m done, I then go to the “Network” tab and hit “Export HAR…” to save a HAR file with the Tweets to my computer.  Ok, so now how do we get the data from the HAR file? How do we even open a HAR file? Well I’ve built a free tool I have linked to in the description: https://stevesie.com/har-file-web-scraper that will do this for you. You simply drag and drop the HAR file into your browser and it will process it for FREE, presenting you back with the raw JSON data from Twitter containing the tweets we just saw.  We can even search through the data to jump to the specific JSON response with your search term. And I can download each request here for FREE, seeing the raw JSON here. I can see the text of the Tweet, timestamp, mentions, images, videos, etc…  Now what if I need the data in a more usable format and combined together… like I ideally want all of the Tweets we looked at combined into a single CSV file instead of all these individual JSON files.  Well for premium Stevesie users, they’ll see this parse button here at the top of the request group. This will automagically parse the combined JSON responses together and convert it into “collections” which I can then download as CSV files containing all the Tweets here.  I can see all the combined Tweet contents, timestamps, hashtags, images, etc… all in one CSV file.  This approach should work with a lot of other Twitter data too - it looks like we just need to keep poking around the site and the free HAR File Web Scraper will help us access the raw data.  Now you may be asking, is this legal? Well keep in mind we legally used Twitter, right? The only thing we did differently was to record the network traffic that Twitter sent to our computer and then post-processed that logged data in a more usable format, like CSV format.  The only legal issue you could face here is if you do something not-so-nice with the data after scraping it - that’s where 9 / 10 of legal problems arise from when it comes to data scraping. E.g. if you re-publish the data somewhere else without permission, that would be bad. If you just want to use the data privately… that’s probably fine.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter API restrictions, developer terms, etc… they seem much more concerned with you disclosing any sensitive data, so be sure to read up on what you can re-publish to protect other Twitter users’ privacy.";"UCArmutk8nAbYQdaYzgqKOwA";"Stevesie Data"

In this video, I show you exactly how to do just that along with some tips and tricks to help you save money, so follow along with me and you'll be able to quickly and easily create your campaign as well.  Table of contents:  0:00 - Introduction 0:53 - Create your Facebook Ads account 4:40 - Create your Facebook page 8:09 - Create your Facebook campaign 12:59 - Ad set settings 30:44 - Creating the ad 38:18 - Ad preview & conclusion  Step 1 - Create your Facebook Ads account  To create your Facebook Ads account, you first have to create a personal Facebook account.  You can do that by simply going to https://facebook.com and creating an account there.  Once you are done with that, head over to the Facebook for Business site:  ğ Facebook for Business signup: https://business.facebook.com  And create an account here. It's pretty straightforward, enter your business name, email, your name, and so on, and you'll have your account up and running.  Then, just verify your email, enter your billing information and create a new account by selecting the ""Ad account"" tab.  Pretty straightforward and congratulations on creating your first Facebook Ads account!  Let's move on to the next step of this Facebook Ads tutorial.  Step 2 - Create your Facebook page  Unlike Google or Bing ads, you do have to create a Facebook page to promote here.  Simply click on the ""Pages"" tab and create a new page. It's a pretty simple and straightforward process, so just select what you want to promote, enter a name for your page and then go in there and make it look nice - add images, banner, description, and so on.  I don't go over this in detail in this video not to go off-topic, but if you want more information in detail on how to do this, check out my Facebook Ads course here:  ğ Paid ad network courses: https://ivanmana.com/all-courses  Let's move on the next step of this Facebook Ads tutorial in 2021.  Step 3 - Create your Facebook campaign  Once you create the ad account and the page, you're ready to start promoting on Facebook Ads.  Click on ""Ads Manager"" at the top-left of your dashboard and you'll be taken to your main Campaign dashboard.  From here on, click on ""Create new campaign"" and fill in the blanks, entering your daily or lifetime budget for the campaign, your campaign objective, and your campaign name.  Note: you will find the most value by selecting the Conversions campaign objective once you have some conversion data... to set up the pixel, follow this video as I explain it in great detail:  ğ How to set up the Facebook Ads pixel (conversion tracking): https://youtu.be/TLcH-7PDMeA  Step 4 - Ad set settings  Once you finish the campaign, you have to set up the ad set.  This is also where you can set the budget if you choose to do so, but mainly this is where you set your targeting - the device, gender, age, interest groups, audiences and so on.  When you are first starting out, you will likely not have any audiences or remarketing lists handy... so you will want to use ""interest group"" targeting, which means targeting people based on the pages they like on Facebook, their employers, behaviors, and so on.  Normally I would use the audience insights tool to get more information and do research on this, so take a look at this video to learn how you can do it too:  ğ How to use the Facebook Ads audience insights tool like a pro: https://youtu.be/yKJqtwa9CWk  Once you are happy with your targeting options, let's move on to the final step in this Facebook Ads tutorial for 2021.  Step 5 - Creating the ad  At last, the moment we've all been waiting for... creating the ad.  Again, you can simply go from top to bottom and fill in the blanks, entering the headline, description, ad text, website URL and image or video.  Once you fill the ad out the way you want it to, you can publish the campaign, and then preview it to see what it's going to look like.  Don't worry - the campaign will be under review while you preview it... you can also just go ahead and pause the campaign just in case while you make sure that it looks the way you want it to.  Then you can just duplicate ads and ad sets to test different variations.  And this is it for this Facebook Ads tutorial for beginners in 2021!

In this video, I show you exactly how to do just that along with some tips and tricks to help you save money, so follow along with me and you'll be able to quickly and easily create your campaign as well.  Table of contents:  0:00 - Introduction 1:10 - Create your Google Ads account 3:23 - Create a campaign 11:31 - Ad group settings 18:19 - Creating the ad 24:41 - Look at our campaign & additional things to do  Step 1 - Create your Google Ads account  You can create your Google Ads account by going here:   ğ https://ads.google.com/  And follow the steps needed to create an account. I personally use a Gsuite account for my Google Ad account because it's easier to integrate other Google services together, but you can use any email you want to sign up.  It's also very important that you choose ""expert mode"" at the bottom of the page after signing up because you do NOT want to create a ""Smart"" campaign. It just wastes money and takes away a LOT of customization options from you.  Also, just select ""continue without a campaign"" and we'll build it out together.  Let's move on to the next part of this Google Ads tutorial for 2021.  Part 2 - Create a campaign  From your main dashboard, click on the little ""plus"" sign or ""create new campaign"" to create a new campaign.  We will just go from top to bottom in filling in the blanks, so follow along with me and we'll get this done together.  There are lots of settings here and you shouldn't feel overwhelmed because some of them aren't required at all. But I will go through a few of these that are important.  First, enter your campaign name. If your budget is constrained and you don't feel like experimenting, uncheckmark the display and Google search partner networks - we want to only promote on google.com.  Enter your location (and make sure to select people that are IN your location only), budget, and bid. There is no minimum or maximum budget amount, so enter whatever you feel most comfortable with. For the bid, I'd recommend going with manual CPC for now and as you start getting conversions you can easily switch that over to target CPA.  Leave the other options as they are for now, such as the extensions or dynamic search ads - I cover that in my Google ads playlist or if you prefer something more comprehensive, my course, linked at the bottom of this description, and these aren't necessary to create our first campaign, they only improve an existing campaign.  Once you do all that, click ""next"" and it's time for the keyword phase!  Part 3 - Ad group settings  This is the ""heart"" of your campaign and where you'll probably spend most of your time.  You are going to add keywords here and normally I use the keyword planner to do keyword research so I can get some ideas for relevant search terms that someone might be typing in to trigger my ads.  ğ How to use the Google Ads keyword planner like a pro: https://youtu.be/OtghevfdfFI  For the purpose of this video, we're just going to add some keywords that I think make sense, and create another ad group for a different ""theme"" of ad groups.  Normally you want to create several of these ad groups with different-themed keywords so you can create tailored ads to each of these groups.  But let's go on to the last step in this Google Ads tutorial in 2021.  Part 4 - Creating your ad  This is where you create your ad. I like to split test 2-3 ad variations at a time, split testing one thing at a time, such as headline 1 or 2 and in some cases the description.  As a rule of thumb, I like to have my keyword in headline 1, and a call-to-action in headline 2 to prompt users to take the action you want them to. If you don't tell your visitors what to do, they won't!   Once you do that, click ""next"".  Part 5 - A look at our campaign & additional options  Once you fill in the campaign, ad group and ad settings, you're done with your campaign! Congratulations!  You can go back in to navigate your campaign and look at the specific keywords or ads and edit them when needed.  I also suggest you set up conversion tracking and add negative keywords to your campaign. I cover both of these in my Google Ads playlist.  And this is it for this Google Ads tutorial for beginners in 2021!

From here, you should be able to advertise with your fan pages under your brand.   This is extremely important to note as you may be an agency (like myself) managing multiple client accounts.   Targeting your audience:   Once your account is created, you're going to create an ad with the following objectives in the business manager. These objectives are:   - traffic  - engagement  - video views  - lead form   And much more. These are the commonly used ones. Although this is dependent on your goal, choose one that suits your marketing objectives.   Once you choose your objective, you should now choose exactly what targeting you want. You can target users based on:   - behaviors  - Interests  - Demographics   These are generally the options you'll have when targeting. Once you have your audience targeted properly, you'll then have the ability to display a photo or a video to your audience.

Don't use the promote button on Instagram to run ads.  That option is very limited and you'll get better results on Facebook.  Facebook owns Instagram and they share the same ad platform.  The Instagram and Facebook ad platform is broken up in 3 parts.  The campaign, Ad Set, and Ads.  To run Instagram ads, you should set up a Facebook Business Manager account. You can sign up for one here: https://business.facebook.com/  If you want to create an effective video ad for Instagram, watch the how-to create Instagram ads video: https://youtu.be/HDSjLy-X_Nw  You can run Instagram ads without this with a personal ad account, but this will help you expand in the future and keeps things much more organized.  Once you create a Facebook business manager and fill out your information, you can go to your ad account and create a campaign. Choose a campaign goal based on your intent.  You can choose reach or brand awareness if you are just trying to get eyeballs on your post.  Consideration campaigns are best for sending people to a website, to get video views, or simply as a lead generation tool.  Conversation campaigns really track the end results from your Instagram ads and are best for tracking sales.  Once you create your campaign, you'll select ad sets.  This is your targeting on who will see your ads.  You can choose by location, age, gender, interest, activity and the countless number of settings to laser focus your targeting. You can also set your budget and duration of your Instagram ad, here.  The final step is creating your actual ad.  This is the ad creative from the title, to the description to photo or video that you'll use in your ad.  During the entire setup process, look at your potential reach.  This is the total number of people your Instagram ad can reach based on many factors through the setup process. You want this to not be too specific and not too broad.

In this video, you will learn about a wireless technology called Zigbee.  Before getting into the video, I am sure that you are familiar with short-range wireless networking technologies like wifi and Bluetooth which are used to connect devices. These technologies are fairly mainstream today and are used in specific use cases. For example, if you want to stream audio you are likely to use Bluetooth. Likewise, if you are streaming video or large files, you are likely to use WiFi. But, let us think of a use case where we have to connect a large number of battery-operated devices. Is it ok to operate them using Wifi or Bluetooth?  The answer is clearly NO. Wifi consumes a lot of power and is therefore not ideal for battery-operated devices. Most of the WiFi devices like your mobile phones or your laptop are usually charged on a daily basis.  Then what about Bluetooth? you may say well, Bluetooth consumes less power than wifi so would that not be ideal for our use case?  But, You can connect only a limited number of devices to a Bluetooth network and therefore BlueTooth is not ideal for our use case as well.  So, what could be a better solution to connect a large number of battery-operated devices?. Enter Zigbee  But what exactly is this term Zigbee?  Zigbee, like Wifi and Bluetooth, is a short-range wireless protocol.  The Zigbee is built on top of the  IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer and is designed to meet the needs of low-cost battery-operated applications where Longer battery life is of the major concern.  It also operates in the 2.4 GHz band spectrum where wifi and Bluetooth operate.   Unlike the other two technologies, Zigbee operates at a very low data rate of 250kbps. And this is the tradeoff we need to live with when we are optimizing for a low power network protocol that can connect many devices.  A single Zigbee enabled device can reach up to a range of 10-20 meters (indoors) in search of another Zigbee device present in the network.  The Zigbee operates in a mesh topology, which helps the  Zigbee device to transfer its message to its destination via a number of intermediate Zigbee devices connected within the network.  So what is Mesh topology? Don't wifi and Bluetooth follow this?  Well in a basic sense, topology can be termed as a way in which devices are connected to each other.  In mesh topology, there is a coordinator that sends the information, an intermediate device which carries forward this information and an end device which receives the information. All the devices in this topology expect the end devices can communicate with each other and also able to change the paths to deliver the information if any disturbance occurs in the network.  Whereas, In star topology, there are no intermediate devices and the communication is done directly between the Coordinator and the end device. This disables the chance of establishing an alternate path to transfer information at the time of failures. Wifi and Bluetooth are configured as Star networks.  There are 2 advantages to using a mesh network. First, a mesh network increases the system reliability. Second, because of the way data transmission happens in a mesh network, the short-range of individual Zigbee devices stops being a problem. We can add a large number of Zigbee devices which need to transmit data just to the neighboring node. This way, very large networks can be built based on Zigbee. In fact, the Swedish city of Gothenburg is a giant Zigbee network, where over 250,000 homes are connected together for the purpose of remote energy metering.  Coming to the security associated with Zigbee, it uses a 128bit AES algorithm to encrypt and authenticate the message signals via the links which are secured by special keys allowing the end-user to use the devices in a secure manner.  So, where do you think Zigbee is being used? It is extensively used in Smart Homes to remotely access electronics and also in Smart metering  That is all from me in this video, folks.

Bright Side will tell you about 11 simple memorizing tips that will help you remember everything and improve your memory.   TIMESTAMPS Why we forget things 1:04 How to remember everything 2:00 How to memorize something quickly 2:30 How to memorize something for a long time 3:20 Try to understand what you learn 4:17 Learn the most necessary information 5:11 Serial position effect 5:45 Interference theory 6:06 Learn opposite things 7:22 Build your own «mind palace» 7:22 Use «nail words» 8:19 Make up stories 8:40 Use a tape recorder 9:10 Visualize 9:51 Choose only the best materials 9:59  SUMMARY - Your brain is like a hard drive — the space is limited. Remember Sherlock Holmes? He couldn’t name all the planets of the Solar system — this was not because he missed school or something like that, but because he was too smart to have such irrelevant information in his memory. He deliberately erased facts he would never need. This is what your brain does: it protects you from overloading with information. That’s why all new data is stored in the short-term memory, not the long-term one. So, if you don’t repeat it or use it, you forget it very quickly.  A German psychologist, Hermann Ebbinghaus researched the memory and its mechanisms. He described the Forgetting Curve which shows that just one hour after learning something new we forget more than half of the learned information. One day later we remember only about 30% percent. Well, you see where this is going.  - There is a memorization technique called «Spaced repetition». To keep some information in your head for a longer time, you need to try to put it into your long-term memory. Forced memorization is not very effective in this case because your brain can’t make sense of the information quickly and form strong associations. Here it all depends on the reason why you are learning something.  - To memorize something quickly, repeat the information right after learning it.  The second repetition should be after 15-20 minutes.  You don’t need to return to the information between repetitions — just rest and do something different. Let your brain relax.  Repeat the learned material the third time after 6-8 hours.  And you should have the final repetition 24 hours after the first contact with the information.   Do you know any other memorizing tips?

Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.";"UC0n76gicaarsN_Y9YShWwhw";"ComputerVisionFoundation Videos"

Over 50 million car tires are sold each year in Germany alone. But where does the natural rubber for them come from?  The biggest producer of natural rubber for tires is Thailand. More than four million tonnes of rubber are harvested annually in plantations there. And demand for rubber is ever growing - because ever more tires are needed. But the labor conditions in Southeast Asia are harsh - with working days of up to 12 hours and very low wages. In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the ‘white gold’ rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use ""natural commodities conscientiously.” But many car drivers don’t give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we don’t recycle used tires more effectively.   --------------------------------------------------------------------  DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Read more: http://spectrum.ieee.org/video/telecom/wireless/everything-you-need-to-know-about-5g  Today’s mobile users want faster data speeds and more reliable service. The next generation of wireless networks—5G—promises to deliver that, and much more. With 5G, users should be able to download a high-definition film in under a second (a task that could take 10 minutes on 4G LTE). And wireless engineers say these networks will boost the development of other new technologies, too, such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things.    If all goes well, telecommunications companies hope to debut the first commercial 5G networks in the early 2020s. Right now, though, 5G is still in the planning stages, and companies and industry groups are working together to figure out exactly what it will be. But they all agree on one matter: As the number of mobile users and their demand for data rises, 5G must handle far more traffic at much higher speeds than the base stations that make up today’s cellular networks.

We spend about eighty percent of our day at work, the rest is at home. If we have a bad day at work we are likely to take that negativity home with us and vice versa. It is of paramount importance that we create healthy environments in the spaces that most affect our lives by giving of our best and receiving the like in return. The 5 Chairs is a powerful and systematic method which helps us master our own behaviours and manage the behaviours of others. To be a good leader is to contribute to the success and happiness of everyone, at work and at home, on a conscious level. The 5 Chairs offer 5 Choices. Which will you choose?  Behavioral Coach, Corporate Trainer, Author of ‘5 Chairs 5 Choices’. Louise Evans heads up her own organization in Florence, Italy from which she offers international leadership development, cross-cultural transitional coaching and personal development programmes for individuals and teams working in international contexts. She is English but has lived and worked in Germany, France and for the last 30 years in Italy.   Three things have always been important in her life - people, travel and the performing arts - all three of which she combines in her daily work. Having travelled to seven-five countries and experienced culture shock three times, Louise brings multiple perspectives to the present moment to help people connect across their differences. Louise believes deeply in people’s ability to grow and transform. What she values most is helping people strengthen their self-awareness and their understanding of others so that they bring their best selves into the world in every situation.

His research on the metaphysics of the social world lead him to ask fundamental questions such as what are languages, what are banks, or artifacts? Why should we care? Because according to Epstein, asking and answering such questions are the only way we can fix the foundations of social sciences.  Brian Epstein received his doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University, his master's in philosophy from Oxford University, and graduated summa cum laude with an AB in philosophy from Princeton University. Epstein's research interests include philosophy of social science, metaphysics and philosophy of language, focusing in particular on issues in the theory of reference and the ontology of social kinds. He also has interests in conceptual schemes, the philosophy of music and the philosophy of economics. Between degree programs, he worked at a number of technology startups and consulting firms. His interests outside philosophy include music and sound production, hiking and photographing ducks.

In February 2013, the WBCSD launched a guide to support companies' efforts in tackling the challenge of measuring their socio-economic impacts.   The guide has been developed to help business perform 3 essential tasks: (i) firstly, to define and articulate the business case for socio-economic impact measurement within their organization; (ii) secondly, to understand the essentials of impact measurement theory and communicate with internal and external stakeholders on the subject, including on the terminology; (iii) and finally, to navigate the landscape of measurement tools, and identify those that best meet companies' needs. The guide profiles 10 existing tools tailored to business needs, dissected on the basis of functionality, fit for purpose, cost and complexity of implementation, and examples of their application in practice.

Click here http://keeps.com/b2b to get 50% off your first order of Keeps hair loss treatment.   Top fuel dragsters are the most powerful cars built today. One Top Fuel dragster's 500-cubic-inch Hemi engine makes more horsepower than the first four rows at the Daytona 500. It is said that drivers experience more G's than an astronaut headed to space. They have spark plugs that are strong enough to weld metal. Their flame front's measure in temperatures up to 7000 degree's. Assuming that all of the equipment is paid off, the crew works gratis, and nothing breaks, each run costs an estimated $1000 per second and that crazy cost is because a dragster engine needs to be rebuilt EVERY RUN.

A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers.   I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding.   Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast.   You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time.   If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know.   You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications.   If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.   ⭐️TABLE OF CONTENT ⭐️  00:00 What is JavaScript 04:41 Setting Up the Development Environment  07:52 JavaScript in Browsers 11:41 Separation of Concerns 13:47 JavaScript in Node 16:11 Variables 21:49 Constants 23:35 Primitive Types  26:47 Dynamic Typing  30:06 Objects 35:22 Arrays 39:41 Functions 44:22 Types of Functions   ⭐️Related Tutorials ⭐️ Node tutorial for beginners:  https://youtu.be/TlB_eWDSMt4  Express.js tutorial for beginners: https://youtu.be/pKd0Rpw7O48  React tutorial for beginners: https://youtu.be/Ke90Tje7VS0  Angular tutorial for beginners:  https://youtu.be/k5E2AVpwsko";"UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA";"Programming with Mosh"

REST stands for Representational State Transfer and API stands for Application Programming Interface.   Representational - the resource (image, page, video, profile) is represented by the web server to the client in any format like HTML, Image, JSON, XML etc.  State - the state of the application (web site) on a client's computer changes as the client clicks from one link to the next. Ask the client clicks on the link, they request additional resources, and the application ""state"" changes.  Transfer - the transfer of resources from the web server to the client in a ""representational"" state which can be read by the client or implemented in the application program by the programmer. The transfer may also refer to the application state transfer as the client browses a web site.  API - application programming interface provides useful methods/functions which a programmer can implement into his own application in a chosen programming language like PHP. The API makes it easy for programmers to implement. It's important to note that the response we get when sending REST API request will usually be in JSON, XML or other format which makes it easy to implement in the code and it's not meant to be read immediately by a human being. ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````";"UC1WxZFhq56xs1oxXH-XveSQ";"Clever Techie"

If a plane crashes right on the border between Canada and the United States, where should they bury the survivors?  3. Imagine that you’ve just entered a pitch black room. There’s an oil lamp, a newspaper, and some kindling wood inside the room, but you have only one match. You have to make a tough choice: what will you light first?  4. Mrs. Browny, despite her name, loves the color pink. Her bungalow is decorated entirely in the bubblegum color: pink carpet, furniture, curtains, even the walls are pink. So what color do you imagine the stairs are? 5. 5. One day a man got caught in the pouring rain. Unfortunately, he had no umbrella or hat or anything else he could use to stay dry. Yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How so?  6. How can it be that every single person in a plane crash died, but two people survived?  7. Time for a tricky one so be very attentive: what do you sleep on, sit on, and brush your teeth with? 8. In some months there are 31 days, in others there are 30. But how many months have 28 days? 9. A man dressed in all black from head to toe was walking in the middle of the road. All of a sudden, a huge black car with its headlights off came around the corner and screeched to a halt not to hit him. How on Earth did the driver of the car see the man in black?  10. There were three highly important rooms in the house of an extremely important man. One room was filled with valuable secret documents, the second one was full of money, and in the third room, the man kept expensive jewelry. But one day an arsonist set the house on fire and all the highly important rooms burst into flames. Which of the rooms did the police start to extinguish the fire first and foremost?  11. What’s the biggest problem with snow boots?  12. How do you put a giraffe in a refrigerator? 13. Now, how do you put an elephant in a fridge? 14. Noah builds one more ark and invites all the world’s animals to join him. Every single animal gets onboard, except for one. What animal doesn't board the ark?  15. You’re hiking in the wilderness when you come upon a river. You have to cross it, but you know that crocodiles dwell in rivers there. How can you reach the opposite side without becoming a crocodile’s dinner?

Here are 10 extremely difficult choices you will ever have to make! Throughout our lives, we are constantly bombarded with major choices. Our decisions determine your future and define you and shape your personality. In this video, Bright Side offers you to make 10 extremely difficult choices. At the end of the video, we’ll tell what kind of person you are!   TEST RULES There are only two possible answers to each question. You need to choose between option A and option B. As you’re taking the test, keep track of how many times you chose A or B because you’ll need these totals at the end of the video to find out your results. You’ll only have 5 seconds to think about each question before we give the explanation. Don’t think too long, and go with your gut; you’ll get the most accurate results that way!  WOULD YOU RATHER... ...be the smartest person or the most charming? 1:17 ...you rather always have to tell the truth or lie? 1:47 ...never have Internet or never take an airplane? 2:21 ...find true love or win a million dollars? 3:04 ...never be able to speak or have to say everything on your mind? 3:28 ...have a photographic memory or be able to forget anything you want? 4:09 ...never have sex again or never eat your favorite food? 4:50 ...be the only person to live a happy life or be the only person to live an unhappy life? 5:19 ...be the first person to discover an inhabitable planet or inventor of a drug that cures a deadly disease? 5:58 ...be poor but able to help people or get incredibly rich by hurting other people? 6:38  SUMMARY If you chose A 1 to 3 times, you’re a pretty selfish person. Very few people would like to work with you on a team. It’s not that bad though; it just means that you prefer fighting for yourself to get exactly what you want.   If you chose option A 4 to 6 times, it means that you’re moderately selfish. You’re like the Goldilocks of this list: not too much, not too little, just right. Pretty much most people would fall into this category. You can be selfish when you need to be.  If you chose option A 7 to 10 times, you’re the type of person who is always ready to sacrifice your own interests for someone else.   What results did you get? Do you agree with them?

Welcome to The Kruskal Count.  David Copperfield is probably the most famous living magician/illusionist, and he’s made use of the Kruskal Count to convince millions of people worldwide that he harbors amazing predictive powers. Does he? Well… yes and no.  At the core of his mathematical mind reading is physicist Martin Kruskal’s discovery that certain counting games are really a sequence of chains that can intersect and eventually become one single chain. Using that knowledge of well-concealed probability, it’s easy to perform a mind-blowing demonstration that appears to be pure magic.  But it doesn’t *always* work, because that’s the way probability goes. Sometimes it’s perfect, sometimes it isn’t. By examining the Kruskal Count as a magic trick and also through its original card-based format, we’ll see that magic can be math… and math can be magic.

How are they even possible?";"Hi Everyone :)  Welcome back!  Buy physicsfun toys on :https://bit.ly/2MOjFET  This video contains many interesting / satisfying /innovative  science puzzles / physics puzzles.   If you guys liked this video please follow us on Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/physicsfun/  And subscribe to our channel @physicsfun   Learn more about these amazing toys visit  https://www.physicsfunshop.com/   This video contains:  0:03 👉🏻 Impossible Nail: Not impossible, but creating this does depend on the use of some amazing physical properties of wood. I won’t reveal the method here but a quick search on YouTube produces a few how-to videos showing the process. The nice version of this puzzle featured here is from @emvz.creations (mechanics, physics, engineering, STEM, puzzle, science)  0:36 👉🏻 Impossible Bolt: Not impossible- but carefully engineered and machined. This puzzling curiosity was inverted by Scott Eliott and machined in solid brass by puzzle crafters Steve Nicholls and Ali Morris of TwoBrassMonkeys.   1:57 👉🏻 Impossible Jar with Golf Ball: The puzzle aspect is to consider how this object was produced. This incredible piece was made by craftsman and artist Nathan Nickerson, and comes with the golf tee display stand (a nice touch!)   2:27 👉🏻 Impossible Bottle Sculpture Puzzle: The puzzle aspect is to consider how the bottle was produced (I personally have some theories- but I do not know the secrets of this artist). I can tell you with high certainty that the bottle was never cut or altered in anyway, and it was not somehow formed around the objects. This bottle by Phil Evans is one of the best I’ve seen.   3:10 👉🏻 Forks and Toothpick Balance: Incredible DIY physics toy.  (bartrick, balance, centerofmass, equilibrium, physicstoy, stability, fork)  3:38 👉🏻 Impossible Dovetail  (impossiblebox, dovetail, dovetailjoint, impossibleobject)  4:22 👉🏻 Four Marble Puzzle: one of my favorite physics brain teasers- A beautiful and well-made puzzle from Creative Crafthouse.  (brainteaser, marbles, centripetal, centrifugal, rotation, kineticenergy)  4:45 👉🏻 Impossible Arrow: Not impossible, but creating this does depend on the use of some obscure physical properties of wood (similar to the impossible nail). This delightful design was made by illusionist and artist Victoria Skye @vicskye  5:20 👉🏻 Impossible Wallet  6:08 👉🏻 Impossible Knot: how did this overhand knot get into this closed continuous band of rubber? It did not get there by cutting the loop, tying a knot, and rejoining it. Amazingly this band was once a rubber o-ring. How was it cut to produce a knot? An “impossible object” related to the Möbius strip by mathematician and artist George Hart- a brain teaser puzzle he calls “Tying the Knot”.   6:46 👉🏻 Raketti Puzzle   BONUS CLIP  Nova Plexus Puzzle: 12 identical brass rods can create 4 interlocking triangles in a perfect symmetry- look carefully and you can see that each rod is in an identical configuration with the 5 others that connect with it. Precision machined notches on the ends of the rods allow them to interlock with elastic tension such that vector sum of the 5 forces on each rod is zero- creating this astonishing geometry as the equilibrium state. Unlock the ends of any two rods and the system instantly disassembles. Invented and designed by artist and computer scientist Geoff Wyvill in 1978, this puzzle has just recently been made available for sale with a limited production run.

Arguably, a great segmentation addresses the following questions: 1) Who are the target customers? 2) How to serve them? 3) Where do we need to play? To be able to answer these 3 questions, the segmentation has to be (1) actionable, (2) differentiable, and (3) have an economic perspective in mind.  In this Case Study, I segment customers based on demographic characteristics and personal characteristics, totaling 16 in the end. The technique of choice is Kmeans, one of the most simple clustering techniques. The output is 6 characteristics that are interpretable, actionable, and that takes an economic perspective mind. How?

This has become increasingly relevant with the shift towards mediated interaction. Now we can observe and often analyse links at a scale that far outpaces what was possible only decades ago. While this prompts new methodologies, the large-scale networks we can observe can still be informed by classis questions in social network analysis.  In this class, we take a brisk tour through the classic ideas of social network analysis including preferential attachment, small worlds, homophily, the friendship paradox and clustering. Bernie demonstrates how these ideas are not only applicable to modern digital networks but have been updated with interesting insights fromdata on Twitter, Facebook and the World Wide Web itself.

In clinical psychology, network analysis has become increasingly popular as a method of examining how symptoms influence one another and how these relations change over time (e.g., during the course of treatment). At the request of Early Career SIG members, we have organized the first of our series of webinars focused on statistical analysis to provide introduction and hands-on training on network analysis. In this webinar, Dr. Cheri Levinson and her advanced graduate student Ms. Irina Vanzhula will provide a brief overview on network theory and analysis. They will then demonstrate how to conduct network analysis in R using sample data. The webinar will conclude with the opportunity for attendees to ask questions about how to apply these statistical approaches in their own research.";"UCJdjVELGnfTYYCX5bCZ920A";"AED Archive"

In this talk I will present network theory and application of building and analyzing social networks for practical use-cases in Python with NetworkX. _________________________________________________________________  Social network analysis is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It combines a variety of techniques for analyzing the structure of social networks as well as theories that aim at explaining the underlying dynamics and patterns observed in these structures. It is an inherently interdisciplinary field which originally emerged from the fields of social psychology, statistics and graph theory.  This talk will cover the theory of social network analysis, with a short introduction to graph theory and information spread. Then we will deep dive into Python code with NetworkX to get a better understanding of the network components, followed-up by constructing and implying social networks from real Pandas and textual datasets. Finally we will go over code examples of practical use-cases such as visualization with matplotlib, social-centrality analysis and influence maximization for information spread.  Code examples for the sessions can be found here: https://github.com/dimgold/pycon_social_networkx  _____________________________________________________  Dima Goldenberg  I was always excited about looking at patterns, especially in people interactions. This led me to focus on data science and social network research as a career and discover patterns in people behavior. I did my masters research about Influence Maximization in social networks at the Department of Engineering in Tel Aviv University. I love to teach and was teaching different data topics in the academia and outside. Today I am a Data Scientist & Team Lead at Booking.com working on personalization of travel experiences.";"UC-SbPEAZ4Ik2cowdR_Wyfag";"PyCon Israel"

When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.   R is a widely popular programming language in the field of machine learning. R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

In this episode, I'm going to explain what some of the latest advancements in graph networks are and how you can leverage them to build your own graph network in a few lines of Python code. This space has matured so much that there is never a single library to discuss, there are always multiple competing options (which is a great thing). We'll be weighing the pros and cons of the Deep Graph, Graph Nets, and PyTorch Geometric library as well. I'm particularly interested in Graph Networks because of how well suited they are for interpreting the most complex biochemical factory that we know of - the human body. Enjoy!

I show you how to take Sketch designs to create the layout structure. Then I show you the full front end coding tutorial, where I create the structure of the elements in HTML and then make the grid in CSS. I use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the number and size of each element and then I use grid-template-areas to define each block of the design.   Once the web design is completed I show you how to make this design responsive by adding an '@ media' and defining the columns, rows and areas for the mobile view. Finally I apply CSS styling to the font, colors and alignment to make the final polished design.

Follow me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickshyu/  ""Which programming language should I learn?"" I hear this so often from people learning to code, yet I don't believe that to be quite the right approach.  Rather, I've always used project-based learning, where I first think of the project I want to build and then pick the language for the job.  The fact is, I've learned many languages and forgotten them without even using them.  It is also not so much the language, as much as the frameworks and ecosystem around a language that delivers its power.  Over time, languages fade away and many companies won't even use certain languages you might know, but the projects you've created will always retain value.

Check the course landing page for more info.  You'd like to bring data from a web page into Excel? Instead of copying and pasting, use ""Get and Transform"" (Power Query) from the ""Data"" tab. This way you can import website data properly into Excel. Once you create a web query you can automatically get the latest data in Excel. You just have to refresh your query and update the query settings so it runs a refresh at specific intervals defined by you.   Getting data from a web page has never been easier. Just Open Excel, go to the ""Data"" tab and click on ""From Web"". Enter the web address of the external page you'd like to import. Power Query opens and tries to find the html tables on that web page. Select the correct table and transform your data. This step gives you the ability to customize your output. You can for example, fill in the blanks by automatically copying down the top values. You can remove the columns you don't need and clean up the data. Once done, you can view the data in an Excel table, as an Excel Pivot Table or create a connection to the query.  Note: Importing web data with Power Query this way requires the tables on the web pages to be in HTML format - otherwise they're not recognized in the Navigator view.

Download file here: https://trumpexcel.com/dynamic-excel-filter/  This dynamic Excel filter allows you to type the filter text in a text box and instantly extracts the records as you type in the search bar.  While Excel already has a filter and advanced filter functionalities, these are not dynamic. This means that you will have to specify the criteria and filter, and then change the criteria and filter again.   This dynamic Excel filter, on the other hand, filters the data as soon as you change the text in the search box.  This Dynamic Excel filter can be created in 3 steps: -- Getting a unique list of items (countries in this case). This would be used in creating the drop-down list. -- Creating the search box. Here I have used a Combo Box (ActiveX Control). -- Setting the Data. Here I would use three helper columns with formulas to extract the matching data.  00:00 Intro 00:10 Demo of the Dynamic Filter Box in Excel 01:12 Creating a Unique List of Items 02:20 Creating the Named Range 03:17 Creating the Filter Combo Box 05:00 Adding the Helper Columns 08:47 Extracting the Data By Typing in the Filter Combo Box  You can use this dynamic Excel filter when you have a huge dataset and you want to quickly filter it by entering the text. Since this is dynamic, you can remove the existing filter by simply deleting the text in the text box and type something else to filter based on it.   While this advanced dynamic Excel filter works great with a small dataset, you may find that it tends to get a bit slow when you have large data sets. This is because it uses formulas and helper columns which can lead to slow processing time and data analysis.

Process is super simple:  It all starts of with Facebook's central business page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/category  #scrape #facebook #emails  We then select a category, copy the url format and plug into Scrapebox with the differentiator being the location.   Once all URLs are collected, we then plug it into excel and perform our ""about"" sub-url trick.   Once that is done, back into scrapebox for the email grabber...  Hope you guys found this of value.

After extracting the profiles, this tool then finds the company email addresses of these extracted profiles. 10 credits are charged for profiles of which company email addresses are successfully found.  Example: You extract a Facebook group of 10,000 members. If you are able to find the email address of 3,500 members, you will be charged 35000 credits for the emails found.

(Feat. async/await)";"How do you make your Python code faster? The first step is measuring what part is actually slow. We do this using a profiler, such a cProfile. The profiler measures how much time all your function calls take and then you can print or save these statistics to determine where you should spend your time improving. Take your profiling to the next level using a graphical tool like snakeviz to analyze the stats.  I go through a simple example where I go from start to finish diagnosing and fixing some slow code using these techniques. Here we ended up using async/await to fix the problem, but the tools in this video can be used to diagnose all sorts of code problems.  ― mCoding with James Murphy (https://mcoding.io)  Source code: https://github.com/mCodingLLC/VideosSampleCode cProfile docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html snakeviz: https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/ httpx: https://www.python-httpx.org/  AFFILIATES AND REFERRALS --------------------------------------------------- Automatically Improve Python Code Quality: https://sourcery.ai/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_campaign=mcoding&utm_medium=aff  SUPPORT ME ⭐ --------------------------------------------------- Sign up on Patreon to get your donor role and early access to videos! https://patreon.com/mCoding  Feeling generous but don't have a Patreon?

In this tutorial I also demonstrate real world applications and use cases for optional parameters.   For example, a design pattern you can use to extend the behavior of a parent class without having to replicate the full signature of its constructor in the child class.  In summary, this is how optional function and method parameters work in Python:  *args and **kwargs let you write functions with a variable number of arguments in Python.  *args collects extra positional arguments as a tuple. **kwargs collects the extra keyword arguments as a dictionary.  The actual syntax is * and **. Calling them args and kwargs is just a convention (one you should stick to).

However, building distributed applications today requires tons of expertise. Ray aims to make it as easy to program a cluster of machines as it is to program a laptop. The goal of this is to enable many more software developers to take advantage of all the advances in machine learning to solve harder problems without needing to build systems infrastructure or to have expertise in distributed computing. Ray is a rapidly growing open source project used in production by large companies as well as startups and in cutting-edge research. In addition to the core distriuted system, Ray encompasses a collection of state-of-the-art libraries targeting scalable machine learning. These include scalable libraries for hyperparameter tuning, distributed training, reinforcement learning, and model serving. This talk will discuss the lessons learned from developing Ray and deploying it in production, the key architectural decisions that enable Ray's performance, as well as how companies are using Ray for scalable machine learning. https://ray.io/   *****************  https://twitter.com/enthought  https://www.facebook.com/Enthought/  https://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought";"UCkhm72fuzkS9fYGlGpEmj7A";"Enthought"

I will briefly explain ways of profiling the code, discuss different code structures and show how they can be improved. You will see what is the fastest way to remove duplicates from a list, what is faster than a _for_ loop or how “asking for permission” is slower than “begging for forgiveness”.  -----  Did you know that Python preallocates integers from -5 to 257 ? Reusing them 1000 times, instead of allocating memory for a bigger integer, can save you a couple of milliseconds of code’s execution time. If you want to learn more about this kind of optimizations then, … well, probably this presentation is not for you :) Instead of going into such small details, I will talk about more _""sane""_ ideas for writing faster code.  After a very brief overview of how to optimize Python code (rule 1: don’t do this, rule 2: don’t do this yet, rule 3: ok, but what if I really want to do this ?), I will show simple and fast ways of measuring the execution time and finally, discuss examples of how some code structures could be improved.  You will see:   - What is the fastest way of removing duplicates from a list   - How much faster your code is when you reuse the built-in functions instead of trying to reinvent the wheel   - What is faster than the good ol’ _for_ loop   - If the lookup is faster in a list or a set (and when it makes sense to use each)   - How the “It's better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission” rule works in practice  I will NOT go into details of _""serious""_ optimization, like using different Python implementation or rewriting critical code in C, etc.";"UC98CzaYuFNAA_gOINFB0e4Q";"EuroPython Conference"

Concurrency is hard to get right.  Often when asyncio is discussed, people think of it as a high performance concurrency programming paradigm for Python. In this talk however, we approach asyncio from a different angle, one that will possibly help some of you to finally get what asyncio is about. it's not only about performance, but at least as much about correctness and readability of concurrent applications.  It is known that for multithreaded applications, synchronization is hard to get right. Doing it wrong can either lead to deadlocks or broken data structures.  We will have a look at how using asyncio is different from using threads, when it's better and what pitfalls we have.  This talk should be a good introduction for anyone just starting with asyncio, but can also clarify things for people that are using asyncio already. I expect people to have at least used some form of concurrency, either threads or an event loop like we have in JavaScript.  *****  ��: Learn to write clean code and build well-architected systems with audiobooks of the #1 bestselling programming series: https://www.cleancodeaudio.com/?utm_source=codingtech 4.6/5 stars, 4000+ reviews.

Learn XML basics programming tutorial with Portnov Computer School http://www.portnov.com   XML - Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all gratis open standards. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for the languages of the world. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in web services. Many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed for software developers to use to process XML data, and several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages. As of 2009, hundreds of XML-based languages have been developed, including RSS, Atom, SOAP, and XHTML. XML-based formats have become the default for many office-productivity tools, including Microsoft Office (Office Open XML), OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice (OpenDocument), and Apple's iWork. XML has also been employed as the base language for communication protocols, such as XMPP.  The XML specification defines an XML document as a text that is well-formed, i.e., it satisfies a list of syntax rules provided in the specification. The list is fairly lengthy; some key points are: It contains only properly encoded legal Unicode characters.";"UC3CL29MF0ebwaMK-oCmFarw";"Portnov Computer School"

They both share the same codebase with Jed McCaleb as the founder.  They have different targets as Ripple looks at financial institutions, payment providers, and corporations.  Stellar, on the other hand, focuses on the individual, as well as providing low-cost financial services to those in developing countries.  ⚙️ Technology ⚙️  Ripple used to have its xRapid and xCurrent which the project recently decided to integrate these services under one platform called Ripplenet, which is a closed-source network.  With Ripplenet, users have access to global payments, on-demand liquidity, and payout options in more than 40 different currencies. Payments are processed efficiently through pre-validated transactions, which lowers the cost and speed for worldwide transactions.  The technology behind Stellar is open-sourced. It supports tens of thousands of people every day with its decentralized network. Stellar is currency agnostic. It will handle any asset, including fiat currencies.  Ripple uses its very own XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, which it refers to as XRP Ledger. The XRP Ledger focuses on a few primary principles: agreement, correctness, and forward progress.  Stellar’s consensus mechanism is called the Stellar Consensus Protocol or SCP. SCP is a federated byzantine agreement, which means well-behaved nodes on the network can sustain it, even in the presence of nefarious nodes. As a result, SCP is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant.  SCP offers a way for the network to achieve consensus without the need for a closed system to record transactions.  💰️ Tokens 💰  XRP is used primarily as a utility token within the network. Some claim that XRP is a security while others claim that it is a utility token. The FCA recently cleared Ripple by claiming that XRP is a utility token.   XRP is a pre-mined token, with a max supply of 100 billion XRP. It has a current circulating supply of just under 44 billion, with a total supply of just under its 100 billion max.   100 billion XLM tokens or lumens were pre-mined at the outset of the project. Over the next decade, the project plans on giving 50% of its total lumens to as many people as possible.  Currently, there is a total supply of 50 billion XLM and a circulating supply of a little over 20 billion.  👨‍💻️ Partnerships 👨‍💻   One of Ripple's biggest partnerships is that with MoneyGram which brings a $600 billion remittance market to the table.  Ripple also has partnerships with other global payment systems, including Mercury FX and IDT.  Stellar received $3 million from Stripe right out of the gate. If you aren’t familiar with Stripe, it’s a large payment processing company based in Silicon Valley.  Stellar has also announced a relationship with IBM, which allows the project to bring banking infrastructure to parts of the globe that aren’t easily accessible.  Other partnerships for Stellar include Deloitte, Tempo, Wirex etc.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  📜 Disclaimer 📜  The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time.   SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information.   There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.";"UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA";"Programming with Mosh"

XAML stands for extensible application markup language. It is quite similar to HTML and XML because you will see angle brackets, tags, attributes and nesting. Even comments are written the same way. After you create your project, by default you have one window created for you. Window consists of two parts: XAML - your interface, and .cs - your code. When you work on your interface you have two halves: design and XAML. Ideally you use design to preview and XAML to make changes. You can have only one top-level element. In our case we have a window. This window has attributes with values. Every element including a window can have events which are triggered in different situations, for example a window has an event called Loaded, which is fired when all visual elements are ready to be displayed. Since this tutorial is about XAML, not C#, we will not code much. So, let's just show a message which says ""ready"". As you see the event fired, and we saw a message. Let's comment this line not to see it every time. Window also can have only one element which must be a container. You will mainly use a StackPanel and a Grid. And sometimes you will use a Border. If you previously used Windows Forms, bad news for you: ideally you type your code and not use a tool box. But don't worry you will get used to it very quickly. Besides you can preview UI changes when you type. You still can use the toolbox just to see what controls actually exist in WPF. If you are interested why you shouldn't use the toolbox then it's because after you drag-and-drop them they will appear in the wrong place in the structure of your window. Moreover, you will get attributes that you don't need. Let's get started by changing attributes. For example, let's change the height on the window. Now let's get back to a StackPanel and a Grid which have different purposes but I must say that I mainly use a StackPanel when I am lazy and a Grid when I try to make something decent. In a StackPanel elements stack one after one. A StackPanel can have vertical or horizontal orientation. Elements will have an auto size, i.e. size just enough to fit the content. Sometimes I wouldn't recommend using StackPanel at all. For example, if it has horizontal orientation and you add several buttons with different text, each of them will have a different width. If you need something more complex, relative, with columns and rows, you will use a Grid which provides all of that. Unlike StackPanel, Grid occupies everything available. If you define no columns and rows, elements will be placed on top of each other. So, let's define a few columns. Each column definition stands for one column. Controls are defined after column definitions. To place an element into a certain column you should set attribute Grid.Column to a zero-based index. If you want to select a square, just hold the Alt key. Now let's look at any program to see some rows in it. For example, in notepad we see just three rows. Let us define three rows too instead of columns and change their attributes as well. Remember I said that HTML and XAML were very alike, specifically I mentioned nesting. Well, you can nest one container inside another and as far as I know nesting has no limits in degree. You can toggle every logical block in XAML by pressing a little button to the left. If a Grid has multiple rows, you can put another StackPanel or Grid inside a row. Theoretically we could set an equal width manually for each button but we would need to repeat it every time.  In Grid you can define columns and rows at the same time. A very useful feature in XAML is a star which means: take all available space.  In other words, all space except for the space, used by other columns, will be given to a star column.  Moreover, you can give a star to multiple columns which will evenly divide the space.  You can type a number before a star to multiply space for a star column.

Changing from a "" row based"" orientation to a ""column based"" orientation or vice-versa.    In this lesson - Using Excel 2010 for the first time - I demonstrate how to use:  1) Copy - Paste Special - Transpose - great for quickly restructuring your data.  2) The TRANSPOSE Function  which is an ARRAY Function    I find that many of my clients and viewers are now familiar with Copy - Paste Special - Transpose. I really like the new ""Live Preview"" tool for paste Special in Excel 2010!    The only ""drawback"" with this method is that it does not preserve a ""link to"" the original cells. Not a major drawback considering that it does preserve the Functions correctly.    With the TRANSPOSE Function - which is an ARRAY Function - you are able to maintain a link to the source data - as long as you do not delete it!    ARRAY Functions are powerful - and easy to use provided you understand the several ""got'chas"" involved.

Check the course landing page for more info.  You'd like to bring data from a web page into Excel? Instead of copying and pasting, use ""Get and Transform"" (Power Query) from the ""Data"" tab. This way you can import website data properly into Excel. Once you create a web query you can automatically get the latest data in Excel. You just have to refresh your query and update the query settings so it runs a refresh at specific intervals defined by you.   Getting data from a web page has never been easier. Just Open Excel, go to the ""Data"" tab and click on ""From Web"". Enter the web address of the external page you'd like to import. Power Query opens and tries to find the html tables on that web page. Select the correct table and transform your data. This step gives you the ability to customize your output. You can for example, fill in the blanks by automatically copying down the top values. You can remove the columns you don't need and clean up the data.

Well, stay tuned - because I’m going to show you how to get this data in a few minutes using only your web browser.  Now, maybe you’ve seen my other videos on where I walk you through how to use the official Twitter API to collect data. However, a lot of you have complained to me about the Twitter API approval process, telling me they never get back to you, reject your application for no reason, or even suspend your app and never. even. respond. to your appeal after waiting for 2 months with absolutely no response.  And the sad thing is, most of these complaints I get are mostly from students just looking to get a little bit of targeted data for a school assignment or for research purposes.  I mean really Twitter? Really!? If only there were a social media platform I could voice my frustration on…  Well, the good news is that you don’t need to use the Twitter API to scrape reasonable amounts of Twitter data. See, when you browse around Twitter, you’ll notice a lot of these scrolling and pagination requests are happening dynamically, which means they’re sending structured data to our browser as we scroll through Twitter, in full accordance with their Terms of Service.  So if we can then access this data they sent to our browser after we’re done browsing Twitter, we’ll be good and have a copy of the Twitter data they sent to us during our browser session.  We can easily do this using a little known feature in web browsers known as a HAR file export… let me show you.  We just go to Twitter and then right click anywhere on the page and hit “Inspect” to open up developer tools. This will now “record” our web traffic during our Twitter session, so we can easily export a copy of the data that Twitter sends to us.  So let’s try a few things, like scraping tweets by hashtag - I just enter my hashtag in the search bar and scroll through all the tweets. When I’m done, I then go to the “Network” tab and hit “Export HAR…” to save a HAR file with the Tweets to my computer.  Ok, so now how do we get the data from the HAR file? How do we even open a HAR file? Well I’ve built a free tool I have linked to in the description: https://stevesie.com/har-file-web-scraper that will do this for you. You simply drag and drop the HAR file into your browser and it will process it for FREE, presenting you back with the raw JSON data from Twitter containing the tweets we just saw.  We can even search through the data to jump to the specific JSON response with your search term. And I can download each request here for FREE, seeing the raw JSON here. I can see the text of the Tweet, timestamp, mentions, images, videos, etc…  Now what if I need the data in a more usable format and combined together… like I ideally want all of the Tweets we looked at combined into a single CSV file instead of all these individual JSON files.  Well for premium Stevesie users, they’ll see this parse button here at the top of the request group. This will automagically parse the combined JSON responses together and convert it into “collections” which I can then download as CSV files containing all the Tweets here.  I can see all the combined Tweet contents, timestamps, hashtags, images, etc… all in one CSV file.  This approach should work with a lot of other Twitter data too - it looks like we just need to keep poking around the site and the free HAR File Web Scraper will help us access the raw data.  Now you may be asking, is this legal? Well keep in mind we legally used Twitter, right? The only thing we did differently was to record the network traffic that Twitter sent to our computer and then post-processed that logged data in a more usable format, like CSV format.  The only legal issue you could face here is if you do something not-so-nice with the data after scraping it - that’s where 9 / 10 of legal problems arise from when it comes to data scraping. E.g. if you re-publish the data somewhere else without permission, that would be bad. If you just want to use the data privately… that’s probably fine.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter API restrictions, developer terms, etc… they seem much more concerned with you disclosing any sensitive data, so be sure to read up on what you can re-publish to protect other Twitter users’ privacy.";"UCArmutk8nAbYQdaYzgqKOwA";"Stevesie Data"

It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.  What you can do with Python is nearly endless:  Run powerful web applications Fly drones and launch rockets Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis Machine learning including deep learning And many more ways That list is fancy but don't let it scare you. Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.  The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.  Shakespeare had very few tools for writing plays and yet he continues to influence our entertainment despite being long gone.

Assuming you have both of these, go ahead and install the ""tweepy"" module by running the following command inside a terminal shell.  pip install tweepy   Once we have this, we make a Twitter application that will be used to interface with Python code we will write, and allow us to stream and process live tweets.

They pretty much look the same. It’s all about brand awareness, and whether or not your customers can tell the difference between your brand and others. Check out the video for some more tips on brand awareness!  Hey, it’s Chia from Brand24 and today I want to talk about brand awareness and how to measure it.      First of all, what exactly do we mean when we say ‘brand awareness’? Well, brand awareness is based on how well your customers or your clients are able to Recall and Recognize your brand.       So, for example, if you make a shopping list before you head to the store, and you write down a specific brand of shampoo (maybe you like Pantene, Herbal Essences or Aussie) you can say that THIS brand (the one that you wrote down) has really good Brand Recall, because you’re able to remember — or RECALL — this brand, right off the bat.  There’s a second aspect to this, though: let’s say you get to the store, but you forget your list and you can’t remember which brand you wrote down. However, when you get to the shampoo aisle, you can still pick out the same brand of shampoo that you wanted, just because of the color or shape of its bottle. This means that this brand has really good Brand Recognition — because even though you might not remember the name of it, you can still Recognize it and tell it apart from ALL the other bottles of shampoo on that shelf.  This is the basic idea behind Brand Awareness: how well your customers and clients are able to think of your brand on their own — and tell it apart from all the other brands out there.       But brand awareness also tells you more than whether people can recall or recognize your brand, especially when you consider how it’s measured. The more brand awareness that a company has, the more that it stands out among All the other companies producing similar goods or offering the same services. The question, then, is: what makes this brand stand out, and in what way?  A brand might be known for the sheer quality of its product, but it could also stick out for its unique packaging, amazing customer service, clever ads, sustainable practices, charitability, or even because of its pricing! This is kind of like a deeper layer of brand recognition, and by measuring your own brand awareness, you can start to see what exactly makes YOUR brand stand out. So, let’s look at a few different ways to measure brand awareness, such as through your web traffic, your “number of mentions” and your monthly search volume.  So, one way to measure brand awareness is by observing your website traffic over time, especially your Direct Traffic. You can see this inside Google Analytics. There are a few different sources of Direct Traffic, and you can learn more about this in this video up there — I’ll also link to that explainer in the Video Description section below, so you don’t have to pause anything right now...

The other reason why it’s important to find competitors and analyze competitors is to make sure you are providing more or at least the same amount of value to your audience than they are.  The first step when performing competitor research is to identify your 5 top competitors and look them up on the main social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin.  After your find competitors, collect the following information about them for each social network:  Their audience size Their engagement rate Their engagement method  Their posting frequency Their advantages  Their disadvantages   Once you’ve performed your competitor research and have collected enough information to compare competitors, you will have a clearer picture about how to improve your social media communication strategy.  Then, to monitor your progress against your competitor’s progress and make sure you remain ahead, use social media competitor analysis tools depending on which platform you’re using.  For example, should you have a Facebook page for your business and so do your competitors, we recommend using the built-in Facebook competitor analysis tool called “pages to watch”. This feature allows you to add any page you’d like to monitor against yours and easily compare competitors against you.  The great thing about this competitor research tool is that your competitors won’t be notified that you’re monitoring them. Plus, this competitor research tool also suggests similar pages to watch. On Twitter, a tool to analyze competitors we recommend is Klout. Klout is a tool that gives you a score from 1 to 100 which rates a Twitter account’s social media influence. Most businesses have an average score of 40, however, influential accounts will have a score of 50 and above. Ideally, you’d like to have a higher Klout score than any of your competitors. Another social network analysis tool that is useful to analyze competitors is Twitter lists. Twitter lists are the equivalent of folders to categorize and manage Twitter accounts. Users can either create their own lists and make the lists “private” or “public’. Should you be using Twitter lists to monitor your competitors, make sure it is private so only you have the ability to view the list.  This will allow you to check the activity of your competitors all in one place, see what they’re up to, what they’ve been tweeting, etc... and as a result improve your own social media communication strategy. When it comes to monitoring your competitors on Instagram, we recommend the social network analysis tool Talkwalker.  Once you’ve collected all the information necessary that you need in order to have a clearer picture of where you stand compared to your competitors, don’t let that information go to waste. Instead, fine tune your campaigns accordingly. So you can remain one step ahead. The key when monitoring your competition and using social network analysis tools is not collecting too much information or else it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Always improve your social media marketing efforts one step at a time.";"UCAA6w-5QDSmlrs2SBa_Yz4Q";"Social Media Worldwide"

And it’s actually really important to your sales too, because when a brand is very well-managed, the brand equity increases, which means that your brand loyalty also increases --- and a strong brand can even carry your product. For example, take the famous Pepsi Challenge. Over the last decade, Coca Cola’s market share has risen from 17.3% to 17.8%, while Pepsi’s market share has dropped from 10.3%  to 8.4%.  However, in a series of blind taste tests conducted by Pepsi, the results suggested that consumers actually prefer the taste of Pepsi, even though most of them were buying Coke. This is why brand management is so important, because having a strong brand is something that can definitely influence purchasing decisions and increase your sales in the long run.  So how do you do brand management? Or what’s a good brand management strategy? You know, I don’t want to get off track (but I have a story) --- I recently went on this podcast hosted by a couple of guys who work in tech and ecommerce (that’s Johnathan and Dillon from Welcome to Growth) and we were talking about, of all things, brand management. So, of course, the question “how do you approach brand management?” comes up. Now, I had this totally smart explanation in here (point to head) but, for the life of me, I could barely get anything coherent to come out here (point to mouth)... it was pure audio stagefright! These guys were really nice --- I think I’ve just forgotten how to interact with people on any level after these past few months... yeah… (sorry, guys)... so I’m gonna take this chance to try to redeem myself, by explaining what a brand management strategy looks like here:  So, because you want to start by examining public perception of your brand, this makes awareness a key part of brand management --- NOT to be confused with “brand awareness”, which is generally about how well people can recognize and recall your brand. Here, I mean your awareness about how the public sees your brand.  And this all starts with collecting data. So, for brand management, this means that you want to collect all kinds of feedback and opinions that people are expressing about your brand. And, again, unlike brand awareness, which is focused on the number of those opinions, brand management looks at context, because this is exactly what shows you how a brand is perceived.  Looking at context is something you should do anyway, because it answers a lot of questions: it shows you where your brand is doing a really good job at eliciting positive feelings and positive sentiment from the public… and it also shows you where it might be rubbing people the wrong way and causing them to develop some negative sentiment toward it. That’s why this part of brand management --- just gathering all the data and then looking at the context around it --- is really essential to your strategy. Without these insights, it’s hard to know where you need to make improvements.  Now, considering the fact that you can’t really control how people will ultimately react to your brand --- you can only do your best to plan out and implement a good...  ... more tips in the video!";"UCea17GeC7UH5mY4zu7vCkqw";"Brand24"

A lot of companies use media monitoring tools to monitor mentions of their brand, their products, and their campaigns... among other things. And they find a lot of really valuable information that tells them: WHERE people talk about their brand, WHO talks about them, how people FEEL about their campaigns, as well as how OFTEN their products get mentioned... but they don’t always know what they can do with all that data. So, today, we’re going to talk about 10 powerful ways you can use media monitoring data to grow your business.  The 1st and most common way that companies use media monitoring, is to manage their brands. Brand management is about making sure that there isn’t a HUGE difference between the way that YOU see your company, and the way that the public sees it. It entails monitoring mentions of your brand or your company — which lets you see yourself from the outside, with a fresh perspective, through your customer’s eyes. The data that you get by monitoring your brand tells you a lot about your brand health — and it can also alert you to a potential crisis.  Which brings us to the 2nd reason why companies monitor their brands: to protect their Brand Reputation. The great thing about media monitoring tools like Brand24, is that you can automatically filter your data by advanced sentiment detection. So, if you see a sharp increase in negative mentions for your brand, then you might have a PR crisis on your hands — and the sooner you address it, the better.  The 3rd way businesses use media monitoring is to access customer insights. Data is about more than just numbers, and when you monitor mentions of your brand, you get to see what your customers say about it. This can tell you what they like most about your product — and why! The best part about media monitoring is that, you don’t need to disturb your customers to get feedback.  Personally, I’d say that the most important relationship for any business is the one between its brand and its customers… and the 4th way to use media monitoring shows us the best way to Nurture these relationships: through Engagement! Monitoring your brand helps you identify perfect opportunities to engage with your customers and build stronger relationships with them — just by picking up the conversation!  And the 5th way to use media monitoring ALSO helps you connect with your customers — through customer service. Frustrated customers, or users who need help with your product, won’t always tag you in their angry post about your company. Sometimes, monitoring mentions of your brand is really the only way to see when this happens.  The 6th way to use media monitoring data shows you the best websites to display your ads. Knowing WHERE conversations about your brand take place tells you where your potential customers hang out. Maybe this means Quora or Reddit or a site that’s totally new to you… either way, knowing the SOURCE of your mentions will show you where you need to be advertising for higher conversion rates.  And apart from finding the best websites...  ... more TIPS inside the video!";"UCea17GeC7UH5mY4zu7vCkqw";"Brand24"

Hey guys, it’s Chia from Brand24 and today we’re looking at hashtags. One of you recently asked if we could go over a few examples of hashtags, including some do’s and don’ts on how to use them… so that’s what we’re going to look at today. We’ll go over: (1) the top 5 ways to use hashtags for business, as well as (2) the top 5 hashtag mistakes to avoid making, and I’ll show you some examples of all this inside the video…  So, there are a few different ways that you can make hashtags a part of your social media strategy for your business, and the reason why you want to do this is because hashtags can help you: (1) increase the reach of your campaign, (2) build brand awareness, and (3) gain more followers who can become your potential customers. So you definitely want to make sure that you include hashtags in your digital marketing strategy… and there are a few different ways that you can do this:  We’re going to start with some basic ways to incorporate hashtags in your social media strategy, so if you’re already familiar with some of this, feel free to jump ahead to the next chapter… and you can find timestamps for each chapter in the Video Description box below.   1.So, in order to help a greater audience discover your brand, you can use some popular, already-existing hashtags that are relevant to your content. You can find some of these just by running a quick search on the individual platforms that you’re using, or if you want to get really specific, you can also use a 3rd party app like Brand24 to monitor relevant industry keywords and obtain a list of the top hashtags that are used in your industry.  2. Another way to help more people find your content is to throw some ‘related, trending hashtags’ in the mix. Instagram used to show ‘related hashtags’ along a bar on the ‘hashtag page’, but it was removed a while ago. Now, we have to use other methods to find related, trending hashtags. You can use apps like RiteTag or Hashtagify to quickly look up some trending hashtags, or you can use a more specific method that we mentioned earlier, and instead of monitoring industry keywords, you can monitor relevant hashtags to find the top trending hashtags that are used together with them.  3. One more way to identify potential hashtags is by monitoring your competitors. Since you are trying to reach the same potential audience, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on the hashtag strategies that are working or failing for them… and learn how to apply this in the way that you use hashtags for yourself.  4. And in order to help build brand awareness, it’s always a good idea to create your own branded hashtag. These are usually really simple, and just the name of your company. While this won’t help you gain many followers or increase your reach, it will help your audience associate your best content with your brand.  5. And, finally, it’s a good idea to create individual hashtags for each campaign. This will help you track and measure your results and determine which campaign brought you more reach, more mentions, and more PR in general. It’s best to keep these types of hashtags simple, without going too hard on...  ... find more tips and hashtag dos and don'ts inside the video!";"UCea17GeC7UH5mY4zu7vCkqw";"Brand24"

Chia on Instagram ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-Instagram Chia on LinkedIn ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-LinkedIn Chia on Facebook ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-Facebook Chia on Twitter ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-Twitter __________  This week’s video is about sentiment analysis on Twitter. So, I’m going to explain (1) what sentiment analysis is; (2) how to see sentiment on Twitter; (3) and then I’ll show you how to do Twitter sentiment analysis without having to write a single line of code (you don’t need to know any programming languages like Python or R for this).  So, first things first: what is sentiment analysis? Well, sentiment analysis is defined as the process of using natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and categorize the opinions expressed in a piece of text — especially in order to determine the polarity of the expressed opinion, which can be positive, negative or neutral.  In short, sentiment analysis examines human beings and our subjective opinions or feelings on a particular topic. And when we apply that to business or marketing, it helps us understand how these opinions and feelings drive consumer behavior.  Now, human beings are not exactly known for being rational creatures. In fact, in 2017, economist Richard Thaler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for: “his contributions to behavioral economics and his pioneering work in establishing that people are predictably irrational in ways that defy economic theory”.  Basically, we humans are a complicated species, and it’s hard to predict how we’ll behave. I mean, how is there so much controversy over wearing a mask during a pandemic? What makes my cousin support one presidential candidate while I support the other? And why the heck are Crocs so trendy?  You see, people are kinda weird (and that’s what makes us so interesting!) but this is why there are so many books and fields of study dedicated to understanding the driving forces behind human behavior and relationships, such as:  psychology, sociology and behavioral economics. Our individual perspectives ensure that every human experience is as subjective as it is relevant.       And this is where sentiment analysis comes in: the beauty of analyzing sentiment is that it can help us identify and make sense of all the differences and similarities that we share — and platforms like Twitter, which  is overflowing with sentiment-filled tweets, make this data more accessible than ever. We can see in these live Twitter statistics that nearly 500 million tweets are sent every day. That’s approximately 6,000 tweets per second… each of them expressing opinions and feelings on every topic imaginable. And it only takes seconds to analyze the data from millions of tweets with advanced sentiment analysis tools.  We’ve compiled a current list of the top 17 sentiment analysis tools in a blog post (with a brief review of each tool) and I’m putting a link to it in the Description Box for this video, so you can check that out below to find some good sentiment analysis tools.

It’s Chia from Brand24 and today I’m going to show you how to manage your business account on Twitter with some online reputation management tips. There are approximately 6,000 tweets sent per second on Twitter, but learning how to use Twitter Advanced Search commands (which I’ll show you today) will help you filter out the noise so you can: (1) see who’s talking about you on Twitter; (2) learn why your happy customers are happy and your unhappy customers, unhappy; (3) quickly find important questions from your customers that need a speedy answer and, as a bonus for those of you who own or work with a local business, you’ll also find out (4) how Twitter Advanced Search commands can help you generate leads and find customers! Now, if you have a Brand24 account, you can see all of these things inside your dashboard, but in case you don’t, I’m also going to show you how to do this manually on Twitter, because we’re all about sharing here…  Alright, so, the first part of managing your online reputation on Twitter is to actually monitor and just be aware of what people are tweeting about you and your business… and the most important thing to remember here is that you 👏 won’t 👏 always 👏 be 👏 tagged 👏! To see tweets that talk about you or your business on Twitter, use Twitter Advanced Search commands to find mentions of (1) your Twitter username; (2) the name of your business; and I’d also throw in (3) your web domain in case people link to your site without mentioning you. This will show you public tweets that contain your Twitter username, the name of your business and your website… like so.  Now, in case you’re a total newbie when it comes to Twitter Advanced Search commands, you can check out this video, which I’ll link to in the Video Description box below — that video is actually about how to see the number of tweets for a hashtag, but if you fast forward to this section, you’ll find a super quick tutorial on how to access Twitter Advanced Search Commands. Basically, you can use the Twitter Advanced Search form on your desktop or you can also manually enter Twitter Advanced Search commands on mobile (if you know the commands, that is). Then, you can respond to the tweets by commenting, retweeting, or otherwise engaging.  And speaking of engagement, to manage and improve your online reputation, you can also use Twitter Advanced Search commands to answer important questions from your customers.  To find them, just enter the name of your business followed by a “?” in the search bar. For example, here we can see that Twitter expert Madalyn Sklar had a question about how to use Brand24 to find specific tweets that mention certain words. Your Customer Care team (or, in this particular instance, our humble CEO) would definitely want to provide a speedy answer to this question to make sure that the user experience isn’t disrupted…  And once upon a time, things like “questions”, “location” and “tweet sentiment” had a spot on Twitter’s Advanced Search form, but now they’re kind of hidden so you have to enter these Twitter Advanced Search commands manually.

Hootsuite has been around a long time and is still very noteworthy. It works with multiple social networks, but is ideal for keeping track of search terms on Twitter and for scheduling social activity amidst a longer-term campaign. You can start with this platform for free and upgrade as you need new functionality. Even so, the price point remains on the lower end of the spectrum when you're starting to grow, which is a huge selling point.  You can't mention Hootsuite without Tweetdeck, since they're huge competitors in the Twitter-sphere especially in terms of aesthetics and price. It's free and easy to monitor Twitter search activity and you can schedule Twitter social activity, too. It doesn't work with any other social network, but may be a serious option to consider because it's useful and totally free.  People don't often think of the value of Google Alerts within this discussion. Just like you might check Google for certain search terms, you can set up alerts to be sent to you as soon as Google has any new result. This can be very useful for monitoring activity that involves your company's name, as well as being useful for keeping an eye on general information within your given industry. Signing up and receiving these Google email alerts is a great way to stay on the pulse.  The Buffer App is a favorite based on the technology its team created a few years back. It enables you to schedule social activity in advance, through an editorial system in the settings. When you have content to share, you can just write the copy and throw the information in the ""buffer"" for it to publish in the next designated time slot. This saves a lot of time for the busy social media manager trying to keep activity flowing on a company's various social accounts. While it's not totally ideal for longterm campaigns, it is a great tool overall and a free one at that! There's an upgrade option when needed, and a recently added Business account that comes with better analytic capabilities.  Lastly, there is a great platform called Sprout Social, which at first glance may be seen as a high-level Hootsuite competitor. It has functionality to track search info across multiple sites and is very seamless and easy to use. It also offers contact management and lead generation that makes it worth the price (an increase over the others). Be sure to take advantage of the free trial, and after that, it's $35 per month.

But first, what is social selling? And how is it different from social media marketing?  Social selling is the process of finding and connecting with your potential customers through social media. This might sound pretty similar to social media marketing, and there are definitely a lot of areas where social selling and social marketing overlap, but the key difference between these processes is on the scale and in the way that you connect and build relationships.  For starters, social selling is about developing 1-to-1 relationships with a single individual (or a very small group of prospects), with sales being the long term goal. Social media marketing, on the other hand, focuses on 1-to-many communication, with the express goal of increasing the reach of your message to find an even greater audience… and this is the difference in scale.  In terms of the process, social selling is a big part of modern day lead generation (and vice versa) and it is an essential part of nurturing your leads — or building relationships and developing trust. It’s a process that you can technically apply to any platform where you might find your prospects, but it tends to happen most naturally on sites like Twitter and LinkedIn, where you’re less likely to make anyone feel like you’re intruding on their personal space.  So, there are 4 main aspects to social selling, and this includes: knowing how to find your prospects, engaging them in a thoughtful way, connecting with them and building relationships with them and also strengthening their trust in you through a strong personal brand.  LinkedIn has a really interesting free tool that helps you measure your aptitude for social selling, and you might have heard of it before: it’s called the LinkedIn SSI (Social Selling Index). So, this is a tool (or calculator) that takes those 4 factors that I just mentioned into consideration and it gives you a score based on the effectiveness of your social selling activities (I’m going to share a link to the LinkedIn Social Selling Index down below, in the Video Description, so you can check your own score). The Social Selling Index is specific to your activities on LinkedIn… but the skills that it measures can be applied to many platforms… like Twitter.   For example, a super important part of social selling is finding the right people. On LinkedIn, this means knowing how to use LinkedIn’s search tools to find relevant connections… such as people who have a particular job title, or companies that might have a need for your product or service… things like that, and then you can connect with your prospects and...  ... more TIPS inside the video!";"UCea17GeC7UH5mY4zu7vCkqw";"Brand24"

Start here ➜ http://bit.ly/2pKvSiIGoDaddy One of the toughest aspects of running digital marketing campaigns is finding the most effective and efficient way to reach your target audience. Yes, you can buy Facebook ads and play around with pay-per-click advertising until you’re blue in the face, but how do you know your campaign is truly reaching the most appropriate audience? Unfortunately, you don’t always know. That’s where influencer marketing comes in. When properly used, working with Brand Ambassadors can skyrocket your business in terms of reach, authenticity and, most importantly, sales.

So we’ll be looking at: trending hashtags, the best Twitter profiles to engage with, and then sharing one of our favorite tips on how to combine these key pieces of information to boost your engagement on Twitter.  So, by default, Twitter (and everything you tweet) is public — to roughly 330M MONTHLY active users and about 152M DAILY active users since the end of 2019. This presents companies and individuals that are using Twitter for business with lots of opportunities to generate interest in their marketing campaigns and drive more traffic to their websites — especially by engaging with Twitter influencers and really active profiles on the platform who can help amplify your message to reach even more users.       One effective way to boost your Twitter engagement and reach more people with every tweet is by using the best hashtags and tagging the right profiles. This can earn you a lot of interactions, like: retweets, replies, likes, and follows, as well as clicks on the links, hashtags, embedded media and usernames that you include.  A key thing to remember is that Twitter interactions occur between people, albeit online, so tagging the right Twitter profiles is a great way to increase your overall engagement on Twitter, and it starts with keeping an eye on hashtags and topics that are trending on the platform.        Since Twitter is where people go to share news, this means that the topics that users are interested in CHANGE WITH TIME, and pretty quickly. So you need to be in tune with what’s trending at the moment. Twitter gives you some GENERAL information about this: you can see what topics and hashtags are trending by location. Some of them will be relevant to your business, but most of them will be related to current events.  If you’re working within a super niche segment, you might not see any hashtags that apply to your business on this list, but tapping into a super trendy topic by monitoring those hashtags and then tagging the right profiles in your tweet is something that can help you grow your followers, which means that you’ll reach more people with tweets that DO carry your marketing message.  Twitter gives you the first clue to finding trending topics and hashtags right up front, and if you see one that you want to try to tap into — you can find the best Twitter profiles to engage with by monitoring the topic more closely via media monitoring (also known as social listening).

I got another request from you guys earlier, to make a video with practical tips on social media sentiment analysis… so that’s what we’re going to do today. I’m actually a little late with this one, sorry that it took me so long to finally get to this topic guys!     I kind of went a little Twitter-crazy lately, but we’re going to put a pin in that for a minute and move on to take a closer look at sentiment analysis… more specifically, how to measure sentiment on social media.  And we’re going to start from… the end. So, I don’t know about you, but I find that it can be really helpful to work backwards sometimes.  That’s why I’m going to start by showing you the results of this quick little sentiment analysis that I conducted just now to measure how consumers feel about phones with foldable screens (so not a flip phone, but those phones with screens that you can actually fold in half like the Galaxy Fold or the Surface Duo).  We can see that there is some negative sentiment in the data, so not everybody’s crazy about that kind of technology… though, ideally, we’d want to continue analyzing sentiment over a period of time until we have enough data to establish a relevant baseline and determine acceptable and unacceptable levels of negative sentiment towards a product (like foldable screens) - or for sentiment towards your brand!  Now, as requested, I’m going to share some practical tips on how to do all this today, including: (1) how to collect the data you need and (2) how to measure sentiment on social media.  So, in order to analyze sentiment on social media or anywhere, you need to have a working dataset (I mean, you gotta have something to analyze, right?). In terms of social media sentiment analysis, we’re looking for public online discussions or mentions of a particular keyword or phrase in social media, and I’m going to show you how to collect that data.  So, if you have some programming skills, then you can even do this manually by writing code in Python or R to collect data on social media platforms like Twitter and then analyze that for sentiment. That’s one way to do it… but even if you don’t possess the coding skills for that, you can still collect data and conduct social media sentiment analysis by using a media monitoring tool like Brand24.  The first thing you have to do is decide what kind of data you want to collect: you might want to monitor (1) mentions of your brand to do online reputation management, (2) track public discussions about specific topics for market research, or monitor (3) hashtag performance to measure the effects of a social media campaign...  I was kind of curious to see how people are reacting to phones with foldable screens (to me, they just seem so fragile and kind of extra), so I decided to collect data on the “Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2” by monitoring mentions of that phrase on the Internet. As you can see, we collected a lot of data from social media platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Instagram - and beyond...  So, one of the benefits of using a media monitoring app like Brand24 (apart from not having to write any code), is that sentiment analysis is completely automated, and we can look at the data from a couple different aspects.

Chia on Instagram ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-Instagram Chia on LinkedIn ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-LinkedIn Chia on Facebook ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-Facebook Chia on Twitter ➡️ http://bit.ly/Chia-Twitter __________  Hey, it’s Chia from Brand24 and… I recently got a request from you guys to share a few more Twitter Advanced Search operators, so that’s what I’m going to do today... we’ll go over a couple Advanced Search commands inside this video, including some tips on how to use Twitter Advanced Search for marketing.  Now, since we’re focusing on Twitter for marketing, we’re going to cover some Advanced Search commands that will help us (1) identify our top tweets (so we can see what’s been working for us) as well as (2) find a more specific audience that would benefit the most from our content.  So, if you’re a social media manager or small business owner who uses Twitter for marketing, you want to know what kind of content gets the biggest response from your audience. This means that you need to identify your most engaging tweets, both in terms of your hashtags as well as your Twitter account, and there are a couple ways to do this.  So, the easiest way is to just track your hashtags inside a media monitoring app like Brand24. Then, you can automatically see a list of the most engaging tweets from your hashtag campaign (or for any hashtags that you’re tracking) right inside the app. You can also find a lot of other data too, like: (1) you can see the total number of tweets for that hashtag, (2) you can measure your social media reach, and (3) you can also analyze the sentiment of those tweets, and more…  But if you don’t need to analyze or measure any data and you don’t need any numbers; you just want to find specific tweets, then you can also try Twitter Advanced Search. I recommend doing this on your laptop instead of your phone, because then you can use the Advanced Search form, which you can find on ""twitter.com/search-advanced"" — I’ll put a direct link to the Twitter Advanced Search form in the Video Description box below, so you can bookmark it and you don’t have to memorize this right now. I’ll also go over some hidden Advanced Search commands in this video, to help you find information that cannot be found using the form.  Now, from the Twitter Advanced Search form, to find the most engaging tweets for your account, just scroll down to ""Accounts"" and under ""From these accounts"", enter your Twitter username. THEN, scroll down to ""Engagement"" and this is where you can pull up tweets that got at least a certain number of Replies, Likes and Retweets. I’m going to enter 1 as the minimum amount for each of these, so we can see tweets that got at least 1 reply, 1 like and 1 retweet, or more. You can put in any numbers you want, this is just an example.  One reason why I recommend using your laptop instead of your smartphone to do Twitter Advanced Search is because you can’t access the Advanced Search form within the mobile app. However, you can enter advanced Twitter search commands manually in the app — and in some cases you have to because you won’t find everything you need on the form. So, to run the same search that we just did through the form, you would enter this command inside the Twitter search bar: ""From:YourUsername min_replies:1 min_faves:1 min_retweets:1"". This command basically tells Twitter that we want to see tweets from that username with a minimum of 1 reply, 1 like and 1 retweet.     You can sub higher numbers to narrow down your most engaging tweet, or even enter different usernames, like your competitors, to see how they’re engaging...  ... more tips on how to use Twitter Advanced Search for marketing inside the video!";"UCea17GeC7UH5mY4zu7vCkqw";"Brand24"

This is useful as there is often a fixed sequence of steps in processing the data, for example feature selection, normalization and classification. Pipeline serves multiple purposes here:  Convenience and encapsulation You only have to call fit and predict once on your data to fit a whole sequence of estimators.  Joint parameter selection You can grid search over parameters of all estimators in the pipeline at once.  Safety Pipelines help avoid leaking statistics from your test data into the trained model in cross-validation, by ensuring that the same samples are used to train the transformers and predictors.  All estimators in a pipeline, except the last one, must be transformers (i.e. must have a transform method). The last estimator may be any type (transformer, classifier, etc.).

Depending on how your dataset is structured the method that is the easiest could vary and the most common ways to load is either having structured subfolders, a csv with with annotations or simply all of the images in a single folder. We use the functions image_dataset_from_directory, ImageDataGenerator together with flow_from_directory for subfolders. Pandas togethor with from_tensor_slices when dealing with an annotation csv file and lastly list_files when having all inside a single image folder directory. Hope you find this tutorial useful!

Using Column Transformer and Pipelines to do the data pre-processing helps us in more ways than one. First is the easy interpretability, second it helps to prevent data leakage and third it helps us in doing hyper parameter tuning with the help of GridSearchCV etc, among others.

Introduction to SVM   Used SVM to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign (mild state) or malignant (evil state).  SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable (This gets done by kernel function of SVM classifier). A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.  ---------------------------------------- ### 2.

Load Data From CSV File  The characteristics of the cell samples from each patient are contained in fields Clump to Mit. The values are graded from 1 to 10, with 1 being the closest to benign.  The Class field contains the diagnosis, as confirmed by separate medical procedures, as to whether the samples are benign (value = 2) or malignant (value = 4).  ---------------------------------------- ### 5.

These are hard to process if you have hundreds or thousands of them. Sentiment Analysis is a machine-based method for predicting if an answer is positive or negative. Microsoft offers a tool that does Sentiment Analysis in Excel - Azure Machine Learning. Traditional sentiment analysis requires a human to analyze and categorize 5% of the statements. Traditional sentiment analysis is not flexible - you will rebuild the dictionary for each industry. Excel uses MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon (read about that at http://bit. ly/1SRNevt) This generic dictionary includes 5,097 negative and 2,533 positive words Each word is assigned a strong or weak polarity This works great for short sentences, such as Tweets or Facebook posts It can get fooled by double-negatives To install, go to Insert, Excel Store, search for Azure Machine Learning Specify an input range and two blank columns for the output range. The heading for the input range has to match the schema: tweet_text Companion article at: http://sfmagazine.com/post-entry/may-2016-excel-sentiment-analysis/";"UCXbicpVq_ALWG4ijPKsR7ZQ";"MrExcel.com"

It's great for beginners.  However, the video is packed with additional tips and tricks for writing formulas that will help save anyone time when writing formulas.    Here are the major topics covered:  00:00 1. What does Vlookup function do and how does it work? 03:26 2. How to write a simple Vlookup formula? 07:54 3. The two main causes of errors with Vlookup. 12:53 4. Vlookup stops at the first match & the sorting myth. 15:07 5. How to create relationships between tables & ranges. 15:55 6. Vlookup to other sheets.  One thing I forgot to mention in the video is the F4 equivalent keyboard shortcut on the Mac version of Excel is Cmd+T.  This is for toggling the absolute and relative references when writing the formula.  At the end of the video I mention a bonus challenge (https://excelcampus.com/vlookup-challenge) that will help you practice and learn additional techniques with Vlookup.  This includes:  - The IFERROR function for handling errors. - Dynamic Vlookup formulas for adding and deleting columns. - Adding drop-down lists to create interactive spreadsheets. - Conditional formatting to highlight rows based on a matching value. - Vlookup with Excel Tables and Structured Reference Formulas.

Why? Because they allow you to easily add exceptions to your sum, average and count calculations. Don’t make your life more difficult by trying to use excel filters to get your sum. Use the SUMIFS formula instead. You can SUM based on multiple criteria. You can also use SUMIFS to sum if numbers are greater than a certain value.   ★ Get the Official XelPlus MERCH: https://xelplus.creator-spring.com/  Timestamps: 00:00 Why use Excel SUMIFS instead of SUMIF 01:20 Excel SUMIF function 03:10 Excel SUMIFS function  06:06 SUMIFS with wildcards 06:47 SUMIFS with comparison operators 09:17 Excel AVERAGIFS function 09:43 Excel COUNTIF function 10:19 Excel COUNTIFS function 11:50 How to use Excel Tables for dynamic referencing 13:31 Wrap Up  ⯆ Download the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/sumifs-countifs-averageifs/  In this video I will show you a SUMIFS example and explanation. AVERAGEIFS works in the same way.  COUNTIFS function is shorter than SUMIFS and AVERAGEIFS because it doesn’t need the additional sum range. It only needs the criteria range. It counts the number of times the criteria is met.   Not sure if you should use SUMIF or SUMIFS? Stick to SUMIFS. This way you're on the safe side. In case you ever need to add more criteria, you can just expand on the arguments inside the formula. If you used SUMIF, you actually have to replace it with SUMIFS.  ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/  ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/  EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/  GEAR I use: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/#gear  More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani  Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani  Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Nested IF formula (an IF inside another IF) to check for multiple criteria. 4. IF formula with OR function (to check if ""either"" condition is met and then decide the outcome). 5. We also take a look at using formulas (other calculations) inside the IF function and finally: 6. How to use symbols as the result of the IF formula  Your IF formula isn't working? One of the main mistakes is the ""else"" argument. That's the last argument inside the IF function. Make sure you haven't forgotten to specify what should happen ""if"" the condition isn't met. In case you have more than one condition, here's the place to add the second ""if"" statement. An IF formula inside another IF formula is called a nested if function.

This Excel trick is extremely useful in situations where you have a huge dataset and you want to extract part of it by making a selection.   0:00 Intro to the dataset 2:15 Creating a Drop-down List 3:30 Adding Helper Columns to have the formula that will help extract the data 8:18 Extract Data based on the drop-down selection  For example, suppose you have the sales transaction records or various products. You can use this technique to select the product item from the excel drop-down list and all the records for that item would get extracted and listed separately.   Since this is dynamic, you can change the selection from the drop-down, and the results would update instantly.  There are three steps in extracting data based on a drop-down selection: 1. Create a Unique list of items. 2. Create a drop-down to display these unique items. 3. Use helper columns to extract the records for the selected item.  It also uses Excel formulas (INDEX, MATCH, ROWS, and SMALL functions) to extract the data based on the drop-down selection. It can work for extracting the data on the same or different worksheet in Excel  This is a great way to give the user the flexibility to quickly filter the data and get the records that they need.   For example, you can create this to quickly extract the data based on the selection of country name from the drop-down. As soon you the selection is made, this will filter all the records for that specific country.   And you can select another country from the drop-down and it will instantly update and show you the results from the second country.   You can also extend the concept shown in this video to create multiple filters. For example, you can select country and product name and it will extract the data of records that match both the criteria.

Watch this video tutorial to find out how you can use Index & Match for more complex lookup problems. This video shows you how Index Match works with simple and to the point explanation. It first shows you how Index works on it's own and then how Match works and then puts the two Excel functions together.   ⯆ Download workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-index-and-match  Timestamps: 00:00 Is INDEX & MATCH the same as VLOOKUP? 00:52 Excel INDEX function explained 05:07 Excel MATCH function explained 06:29 Using INDEX & MATCH together 08:08 Two way lookup with INDEX & MATCH (data validation) 10:30 How to REALLY learn Excel INDEX & MATCH  Why Index Match is better than Vlookup & why use Index Match instead of Vlookup?  Here are 3 reasons why Excel experts generally substitute VLOOKUP with INDEX and MATCH.  1. Unlike VLOOKUP, which searches only to the right, INDEX and MATCH can look in both directions – left and right. 2. INDEX & MATCH can perform two-way lookups by both looking along the rows and along the columns to find the intersection within a matrix. 3. INDEX & MATCH is less prone to errors. Assume you have a VLOOKUP where the final value you want returned is in column N. Your lookup value is in column A. You need to highlight the entire A to N range and then provide your index number to be 14. If you happen to delete any of the in-between columns, you would have to update that index number. You don’t need to worry about this when you use INDEX & MATCH.   All in all, INDEX and MATCH is more flexible than VLOOKUP. Here are some of the reasons why Excel experts generally substitute VLOOKUP with INDEX and MATCH.   Note: Index match is not case sensitive  Index explained:  The first argument of INDEX is to give it an array. This array (range) should include your answer. You then need to specify how many rows to go down and how many columns to move to find the correct value. You cannot move outside the INDEX range.  The syntax of INDEX is:   • The range where the return value resides. • Number of rows to move down (the row index) • Number of columns to move to the right (the column Index). This argument is optional. If you only have one column, you can leave the column argument empty, otherwise, you need to specify the number of columns to move over, in the range.  The MATCH function’s syntax is as follows:   • Like VLOOKUP, Match needs a lookup (target) value. The user can reference a cell or directly type the value into the formula. • Lookup_array: The “list” (range) where the return values are located. • Match_type: 0 for an “exact”  match.  Index MATCH used together:  When INDEX and MATCH are used together, the MATCH function finds the look up value’s row / column index and then hands this value off to the INDEX function to get the lookup value.  ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/  ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/  EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/  GEAR I use: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/#gear  More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani  Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani  Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

With this knowledge, I decided that the VLOOKUP Function would be the easiest way to complete this task.  Here is a list of the Excel Techniques that I demonstrate in this tutorial: * Move or Copy a worksheet to another Excel Workbook * Create a Named Range to use as the ""Table_array"" in the VLOOKUP Function * Use ""Mixed Cell References"" - e.g. $A4 - in VLOOKUP Function * Use FALSE as the optional 4th Argument in VLOOKUP to produce an ""Exact Match"" * Use IFERROR Function to prevent Error Messages from appearing  I invite you to visit my secure online shopping website - http://shop.thecompanyrocks.com - to examine the many training resources that I offer for sale.

But how do you lookup values in multiple tabs using just one single formula?  ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/  In the video, I show you different versions of getting this done. One version uses VLOOKUP and direct worksheet and cell references. The other version uses INDEX & MATCH and Excel table names and references.

Excel VLOOKUP function, in its basic form, can look for one lookup cell/value and return the corresponding value from the specified row.   But often there is a need to use VLOOKUP with multiple criteria/condition. For example, you may want to use VLOOKUP to find the matching value when the lookup values are in multiple cells.  In this video, I will show you two techniques to use the VLOOKUP with Multiple Criteria   -- Using helper columns and    -- Using the CHOOSE Function.   Both of these methods work well, but I prefer using the helper column method as it's easy and faster. The only downside of using a helper column for doing a multiple cell VLOOKUP is that you have to add an extra column (which is not the case with the CHOOSE array formulas method)  So, instead of just using one cell as the lookup value, you can use Vlookup with multiple cells (i.e., use multiple cells as the criteria in VLOOKUP to fetch the corresponding value)  Read More + Download File: https://trumpexcel.com/vlookup-with-multiple-criteria/  Related Video (Using VLOOKUP function in Excel): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGz6QuEaOo0  Click the link below to Subscribe to the Trump Excel Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=trumpexcel      Free Excel Course - https://trumpexcel.com/learn-excel/ Paid Online Training - https://trumpexcel.com/excel-training/ Best Excel Books: https://trumpexcel.com/best-excel-books/  ⚙️ Gear I Recommend: Camera - https://amzn.to/3bmHko7 Screen Recorder - techsmith.z6rjha.net/26D9Q  USB Mic - https://amzn.to/2uzhVHd Wireless Mic: https://amzn.to/3blQ8uk Lighting - https://amzn.to/2uxOxRv  Subscribe to get awesome Excel Tips every week: https://www.youtube.com/user/trumpexcel?sub_confirmation=1  Note: Some of these links here are affiliate links!  #Excel #ExcelTips  #ExcelTutorial   trump excel,  vlookup with multiple criteria,  vlookup multiple criteria,   #Excel #ExcelTips #ExcelTutorial";"UCi0jBGKMYsoefrRSjyUADag";"TrumpExcel"

Check the course landing page for more info.  Prepare to be amazed! This is the easiest way to combine multiple Excel files from a folder into one Workbook and create a table or a a pivot table report based on the consolidated data.  Many of us send out templates to colleagues and are later faced with the challenge to somehow consolidate multiple Excel files. To append the data into a single Excel workbook can be quite a troublesome and lengthy process.   Sure, a solution for this has always been Excel VBA. But learning VBA takes time and it can be too difficult for a lot Excel users.   In this tutorial, I'll show you a much easier approach! We'll use Excel Get and Transform aka Power Query to combine data from multiple Excel workbooks. We will directly connect to a folder that contains the files and use the feature Combine Files in Power Query. Any time you drop an Excel file in that folder, the data will be appended and consolidated with the rest. You can then create one Excel table for the appended data or create a pivot table from the multiple Excel files.   The best part about using Power Query to merge data from Excel files is that you don't need to write any code! You just need to click a few buttons to append the data from the files.

This video is for you!   Check out the the KNN Podcast here: @Ken's Nearest Neighbors Podcast  Brennan's Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIV3m7XOmE&ab_channel=Ken%27sNearestNeighborsPodcast  To be clear the this isn't to say that the data science role is better than the data analyst role. They are two different positions that require a slightly different set of skills. Many people like my friend @Alex The Analyst prefer the data analyst life!   These are my best tips on transitioning from data analyst to data scientist: 1) Show that you can code - You can do this by building a strong github or kaggle portfolio 2) Highlight your strengths - If you show that you meet the coding requirements, you should celebrate your business understanding or subject area expertise. Companies love to see the value you have driven  3) Apply data science to your current role - There are likely opportunities for you do do data science in your current work. Find them and experiment  4) Let your job pay to upskill you - Many companies offer training or a stiped for education. Use these things to learn data science skills 5) Look for new roles inside your current company - There are likely positions available to you within your current org. Focus here first 6) Join communities to learn about new roles - If you need to look outside your current company, communities are the best place to start.

This is truly is job-worthy. This github style is a little different than the ones I have done in the past. Darwin uses a single folder structure that is very organized rather than having all of his projects in different repos. This is a totally fine approach and it clearly worked well for him.  Take Aways: - Great data science project overviews. Simple for a recruiter to understand  - Clear sense of order in the folder structure - Excellent and detailed documentation  - TLDR is a nice touch  - ReadMe files in each folder is not something I have seen frequently used  - Clear why data science projects are relevant to him - Did research (great work experience) - Showcased tableau experience (great for showing business knowledge)  #DataScience #KenJee   ⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast 🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter 📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY 🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: 🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS 👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ 📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee 📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee 💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers 🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

Learn SQL and be efficient with manipulating data in Python or R.  2) You don't always get to work on projects that are exciting to you. In school you choose many of the data sets and projects that you do. Almost universally, at work, your day to day projects are dictated by your boss.  3) You can learn a tremendous amount from other people. Data Scientists are incredibly smart and come from a range of backgrounds.   4) Data science is constantly growing. With the field being broadly defined, there is almost a limitless amount of things to learn.  5) Office politics do play a role in data science. If you are interested in management after data science, it could be good to know who makes the strategic decisions.   6) Data science is very different at different companies depending on the size and growth phase of the organization.  7) Put some time into learning implementation frameworks (Docker & Sagemaker)  8) Statistical significance plays a different role in the business setting. If the expected value is positive, you should at least try it.  #DataScience #KenJee   ⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast 🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter 📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY 🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: 🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS 👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ 📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee 📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee 💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers 🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

We created this series as an introduction to programming with Python.  Why Python? It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.  What you can do with Python is nearly endless:  Run powerful web applications Fly drones and launch rockets Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis Machine learning including deep learning And many more ways That list is fancy but don't let it scare you. Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.  The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.  Shakespeare had very few tools for writing plays and yet he continues to influence our entertainment despite being long gone. Creativity mixed with the right tools can transform how we do everything or why we do it.  That's why I want to teach you this tool. The world needs your creatively, your perspective, your project.

As Octoparse simulates human interaction with a webpage, it allows you to pull all the information you see on any website, such as Twitter. For example, you can easily extract Tweets of a handler, tweets containing certain hashtags, or posted within a specific time frame, etc.   All you need to do is to grab the URL of your target webpage and paste it into Octoparse built-in browser. Within a few point-and-clicks, you will be able to create a crawler from scratch by yourself. When the extraction is completed, you can export the data into Excel sheets, CSV, HTML, SQL, or you can stream it into your database in real-time via Octoparse APIs.   Step 1: Input the URL and build a pagination 1:24 Twitter applies “Infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to first scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.  Step 2: Build a loop item to extract the data 2:28 Make sure you go into the action setting of the “extract data” step. Click on the handler, and click “extract the text of the selected element”. Repeat this action to get all the data fields you want.  Step 3: Modify the pagination setting and execute the crawler 4:03 As we want Twitter to load the content fully before the bot extracts it, let’s set up the AJAX time out as 5 seconds, to give Twitter 5 seconds to load after each scroll.   Then, set up both the scroll repeats and the wait time as 2 to make sure that Twitter loads the content successfully. Now, for each scroll, Octoparse will scroll down for 2 screens, and each screen will take 2 seconds.   Head back to the loop item setting to edit the loop time to 20. This means that the bot will repeat the scrolling for 20 times.

This video may just help. I go through how I have dealt with feelings of overwhelm, inadequacy, hopelessness, confusion, stress, and anxiety during my data science learning. 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY #66daysofdata: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee KNN Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast  In order to deal with these discouraging feelings, we need to first get more specific with what we are feeling. More broadly, I find that these feelings come in a couple different varieties. (Confusion, anxiety, stress, and frustration), overwhelm/ Hopelessness, and inadequacy.   The first group of feelings are usually temporary. The arise when we are struggling with a specific problem. I find that these manifest themselves in physical symptoms for myself. I get headaches, I get antsy, I feel tired. To combat these, I have found that a physical change is the most effective remedy.   For overwhelm and hopelessness in data science, these feelings don't go away easily. Usually you feel helpless after you get overwhelmed by how big the field is. First, no one is expected to have an understanding over the complete domain of data science. There are a couple things you can do here. First, focus on projects. These are a great way to narrow the scope of learning. Second, build or subscribe to a structured course of study. 365 Data Science (the sponsor of this video), provides a great curriculum for this.  Finally, the feeling of inadequacy is the largest contributor to discouragement (Impostor Syndrome). I first recommend starting to cultivate a growth mindset. Second, track your progress, remind yourself how far you've come. Finally, use real data to evaluate yourself.   0:00 Intro 1:00 Find out Why 1:32 Anxiety, Confusion, & Frustration 3:25 Overwhelm & Hopelessness 6:20 Inadequacy (Impostor Syndrome) 9:05 Stop Discouragement Before It Starts! #DataScience #KenJee   ⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast 🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter 📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY 🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: 🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS 👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ 📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee 📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee 💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers 🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

This video will show you how to clean data by removing and/or imputing null values, cleaning and standardizing data types, and using graphs to understand anomalies in your data.   #DataScience #DataScienceFundamentals #DataCleaning #Python Fundamentals Exploration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9dGmL2G-4k&list=PL2zq7klxX5ATPC8RuqCuTDdki3b4NqKQv&index=2&t=23s  Fundamentals Manipulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIJrCFXs0rU&list=PL2zq7klxX5ATPC8RuqCuTDdki3b4NqKQv&index=3&t=0s  Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/ Data: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data Code with comments: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/fundamentals  Concepts Shown: 1:53 Read in the data  2:55 Understand features of the data set  3:25 Remove duplicates from data set  4:15 Finding columns with null values & finding the % null in each column  6:50 Removing null values  10:00 Imputing null values 12:45 Cleaning text data  15:30 Converting between data types  22:20 Box plots and histograms  25:00 Normalizing outliers 30:30 Feature scaling Min-Max  #KenJee   ⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast 🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/ ✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter 📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)  Partners & Affiliates  🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY 🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee  MORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE: 🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS 👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ 📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee 📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee 💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers 🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com  Check These Videos Out Next!

NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.  Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.  In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports. Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.  💻 Course created by Santiago Basulto from RMOTR 🔗 Check out all Data Science courses from RMOTR: https://rmotr.com  ⚠️ Note: Instead of loading the notebooks on notebooks.ai, you should use Google Colab instead.

In this video I go through how to clean up your data to make it usable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building.   github repo for this project: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj  Data cleaning is an extremely important and often overlooked step in the data science lifecycle. Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach.  The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves.  I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features.   Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

Well, stay tuned - because I’m going to show you how to get this data in a few minutes using only your web browser.  Now, maybe you’ve seen my other videos on where I walk you through how to use the official Twitter API to collect data. However, a lot of you have complained to me about the Twitter API approval process, telling me they never get back to you, reject your application for no reason, or even suspend your app and never. even. respond. to your appeal after waiting for 2 months with absolutely no response.  And the sad thing is, most of these complaints I get are mostly from students just looking to get a little bit of targeted data for a school assignment or for research purposes.  I mean really Twitter? Really!? If only there were a social media platform I could voice my frustration on…  Well, the good news is that you don’t need to use the Twitter API to scrape reasonable amounts of Twitter data. See, when you browse around Twitter, you’ll notice a lot of these scrolling and pagination requests are happening dynamically, which means they’re sending structured data to our browser as we scroll through Twitter, in full accordance with their Terms of Service.  So if we can then access this data they sent to our browser after we’re done browsing Twitter, we’ll be good and have a copy of the Twitter data they sent to us during our browser session.  We can easily do this using a little known feature in web browsers known as a HAR file export… let me show you.  We just go to Twitter and then right click anywhere on the page and hit “Inspect” to open up developer tools. This will now “record” our web traffic during our Twitter session, so we can easily export a copy of the data that Twitter sends to us.  So let’s try a few things, like scraping tweets by hashtag - I just enter my hashtag in the search bar and scroll through all the tweets. When I’m done, I then go to the “Network” tab and hit “Export HAR…” to save a HAR file with the Tweets to my computer.  Ok, so now how do we get the data from the HAR file? How do we even open a HAR file? Well I’ve built a free tool I have linked to in the description: https://stevesie.com/har-file-web-scraper that will do this for you. You simply drag and drop the HAR file into your browser and it will process it for FREE, presenting you back with the raw JSON data from Twitter containing the tweets we just saw.  We can even search through the data to jump to the specific JSON response with your search term. And I can download each request here for FREE, seeing the raw JSON here. I can see the text of the Tweet, timestamp, mentions, images, videos, etc…  Now what if I need the data in a more usable format and combined together… like I ideally want all of the Tweets we looked at combined into a single CSV file instead of all these individual JSON files.  Well for premium Stevesie users, they’ll see this parse button here at the top of the request group. This will automagically parse the combined JSON responses together and convert it into “collections” which I can then download as CSV files containing all the Tweets here.  I can see all the combined Tweet contents, timestamps, hashtags, images, etc… all in one CSV file.  This approach should work with a lot of other Twitter data too - it looks like we just need to keep poking around the site and the free HAR File Web Scraper will help us access the raw data.  Now you may be asking, is this legal? Well keep in mind we legally used Twitter, right? The only thing we did differently was to record the network traffic that Twitter sent to our computer and then post-processed that logged data in a more usable format, like CSV format.  The only legal issue you could face here is if you do something not-so-nice with the data after scraping it - that’s where 9 / 10 of legal problems arise from when it comes to data scraping. E.g. if you re-publish the data somewhere else without permission, that would be bad. If you just want to use the data privately… that’s probably fine.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter API restrictions, developer terms, etc… they seem much more concerned with you disclosing any sensitive data, so be sure to read up on what you can re-publish to protect other Twitter users’ privacy.";"UCArmutk8nAbYQdaYzgqKOwA";"Stevesie Data"

Search engine giants such as Google have mandated JSON-LD as a preferred means of adding structured data to web pages to make them considerably easier to parse for more accurate search engine results. The Google use case is indicative of the larger capacity for JSON-LD to increase web traffic for sites and better guide users to the results they want.  Expectations are high for (JSON-LD), and with good reason. JSON-LD effectively delivers the many benefits of JSON, a lightweight data interchange format, into the linked data world. Linked data is the technological approach supporting the World Wide Web and one of the most effective means of sharing data ever devised.  In addition, the growing number of enterprise knowledge graphs fully exploit the potential of JSON-LD as it enables organizations to readily access data stored in document formats and a variety of semi-structured and unstructured data as well. By using this technology to link internal and external data, knowledge graphs exemplify the linked data approach underpinning the growing adoption of JSON-LD—and the demonstrable, recurring business value that linked data consistently provides.";"UCv81s_clPJy_odPCFGzKvqA";"AllegroGraph"

Five years ago, releases took months. Now, many products are releasing every two weeks at a minimum. In addition, the past year has seen features being deployed as soon as they pass testing. What’s a tech writer to do!?  In true agile fashion, the response to these challenges varies across products and writers within Atlassian. This gives us a breadth of stories and examples I can share about our experiences in this world. Here’s a high-level look at what I’ll share:  A brief discussion of continuous deployment: what does it mean, especially for tech writers and others involved in the process?  A look at some things that have worked for us. Making the mental shift from releases to features has been an absolute necessity. We’ve also had to change the tooling we use, the processes we follow, and the way we communicate. This journey has also forced us to consider what the documentation equivalent of an MVP (minimal viable product in Agile development) looks like.  There are a few things that haven’t worked out very well! Resource-heavy deliverables (like videos and tutorials) are really difficult to maintain. Communication also increases in importance in a rapidly-paced cycle. These and other areas provide us with some good lessons learned.  The jury is still out on a few experiments! Things like investing more heavily in in-app help and automating doc publication in tandem with code deployment are among the experiments we’re attempting to get better at this new world.";"UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg";"Next Day Video"

React is a project created and maintained by Facebook. React has more than a 100 thousand stars on GitHub and a huge community behind it. React has become increasingly  popular among developers and is also one of the most sought out skill-sets by companies right now.  React has a component based architecture. This lets you break down your application into small encapsulated parts which can then be composed to make more complex UI. React is declarative. React will make it painless for you to create complex UIs by abstracting away the difficult parts.  React will handle efficiently updating and rendering just the right components in your application when your data changes.  DOM updates which is one of the more expensive operations is handled gracefully in React.";"UC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw";"Codevolution"

Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time.   SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information.   There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.";"UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA";"Programming with Mosh"

Three weeks after a client’s measurements have been taken, his suit will be reading for a first fitting. The jacket will have been put together with a minimal number of seams using cotton ‘basting’ thread, and will be prime for a next round of adjustments.   FASHION AS DESIGN is a new course by MoMA that explores  a selection of garments from around the world—ranging from Kente cloth to jeans to 3D-printed dresses. Each week will begin with a conversation between the course instructors—Paola Antonelli, Michelle Fisher, and Stephanie Kramer—that introduces the themes, items, and questions that we will explore.

The dynamic column may constitute the only column in the schema, or it may be added after known columns, as the last column in the schema.  The dynamic column retrieves the columns which are undefined in the schema. This means that source columns which are unknown when the Job is designed, become known at runtime and are added to the schema. This can make Job design much easier as it allows for simple one to one mapping of many columns. There are many uses for dynamic columns. For instance in data migration tasks, developers can copy columns of data to another location without having to map each column individually.  The Dynamic Schema functionality is to help you configure a schema in a non-static way, so you won't have to redesign your Job for future schema alteration while ensuring it will work all the time.";"UCSroxJYBVHJ5g-yrXaDeM_w";"Tech with Azam"

Empecemos por explicar, ¿de dónde proviene esta palabra?  Por sus siglas en ingles ""Hash"" significa el símbolo de numero #, y ""Tag"" significa etiqueta, la cual tiene el propósito de identificar o representar algo, o a alguien, o proporcionar información.  ""Hashtag"" es una sola palabra, y se cree que fue originada desde la red social de Twitter. Sin embargo, como dato interesante, Twitter no creo a propósito la función del Hashtag, y darle el uso que le damos hoy en día.    ¿Cuándo fue que tomó fuerza el uso del Hashtag?  Algunos creen que el primer Hashtag que se hizo viral fue en el año 2009, cuando un avión de la línea US Airways, el vuelo 1549, chocó con una multitud de pájaros, y esto causo que ambas turbinas fallaran, teniendo que aterrizar de emergencia en el río Hudson [Hudson River]. En ese momento un usuario de Twitter escribió un post desde su cuenta para comentar sobre el accidente, y en dicho tweet agregó esta descripción: #flight1549   Entonces, en español, ¿qué es realmente un Hashtag?  Es una palabra compuesta, a la cual se la antepone el signo de numero #  ¿Qué es una palabra compuesta?  En relación a un Hashtag, es aquella palabra que se forma por la unión de dos o más palabras, y también se le pueden unir artículos, letras, vocales, números, y otros caracteres si el creador del Hashtag lo considera relevante.   ¿Para qué sirve un Hashtag?  Para entablar, seguir, y unirse a una conversación en las redes sociales, sobre un tema en específico.   ¿Por qué crear Hashtags?  Porque si en lo que haces por Internet estás hablando constantemente de un tema en las redes sociales, y lo haces desde diferentes ángulos o puntos de vista, ya sea porque es un tema que da para mucho de qué hablar, o porque deseas que tus lectores tengan más diversidad para que puedan entender mejor la información que les proporcionas.   Ten en cuenta que cada vez que escribas un post, artículo, comentario, o creas un video, y utilizas el Hashtag que has elaborado para dicho tema, todos esos contenidos que has creado, serán compilados y organizados, en una misma línea de tiempo en la red social que hayas elegido.   ¿Cuáles son los beneficios?  Los principales beneficios de un Hashtag son los siguientes:  # Facilita la búsqueda de temas en concreto. Con el uso del Hashtag, ayudas a tus lectores a encontrar de una manera rápida y sencilla, los diferentes tipos de información que hayas creado sobre un tema en específico.   # Fomenta la interactividad y atrae a más audiencia. El Hashtag anima a participar a las personas, ya sea que se unan en la conversación, o compartan el Hashtag en las redes sociales, y esta última acción es la que atrae a nuevos participantes.   # Consigue más seguidores y tráfico web. El uso del Hashtag, incluyendo aquellos que tú no has creado, te ayudará a conseguir más seguidores, ya que, si publicas un argumento atractivo y relevante, las personas se interesarán por ti, y llegarán hasta tu sitio web, o redes sociales.   # Llegas a tu público objetivo. Un Hashtag bien elaborado y relevante, te permitirá llegar hasta tu publico ideal, porque la persona que busca información en relación a un Hashtag, por obvias razones está enfocada en un tema específico, filtrando así solo a los interesados.   # Genera estadísticas en las redes sociales. Si lo deseas puedes monitorear el alcance de tu Hashtag, existen muchas herramientas que miden y analizan, la interacción de tu Hashtag, te pueden mostrar las métricas cual es el número de personas que lo han compartido, la cantidad de impresiones, determina su tendencia, y muchos otros datos más.  # Identidad y personalización. Recordemos que un Hashtag es todo en una sola palabra, y por lo tanto te da la oportunidad de personalizarla, y hacerla única. Esto sin duda alguna que ayudará a mejorar la identidad de tu marca, productos, y servicios.   # Incremento de marca, reputación, y nuevos clientes. Por el lado de los negocios, el uso del Hashtag sobre algún evento importante que estén patrocinado, o que ellos mismo hayan creado, les ayudará a correr la voz de esa promoción en particular, y es que, por lo regular los medios de comunicación tienden a comentar esa clase de noticias, lo cual puede desencadenar un efecto viral sobre dicho Hashtag, provocando un aumento sustancial de visibilidad de su marca, productos, servicios, y por ende la captación de nuevos clientes.

Since this update, Windows uses AES128 to encrypt password's MD4 hash. Because of that, nearly all tools regarding Windows password recovery became outdated.  Fortunately there is a tool called mimikatz  (Windows-only, but can be ran on Linux by using Wine) created by Benjamin Delpy, that can read passwords' hashes saved in Windows' new format. Note that Windows Defender and Symantec antivirus treats it as a 'Hack Tool' and removes it, so you need to disable them before running mimikatz (run as an administrator).  mimikatz consists of many modules, but you should explore lsadump module, particularly lsadump::sam function.

Instructions are below:  Step 1: Open your CSV file.  Step 2: Insert a blank column to the right of the phone number column.  Step 3: Take not what column your phone number are on, for example, ""numbers are on column D""  Step 4: On the top blank field next to your phone column, enter the following expression below:  =--RIGHT(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE( A1,"" "",),""-"",),""("",),"")"",),10)  Notice the ""A1"" in the formula?  Simply change the ""A"" to the column where your phone number are.  For example, if your phone numbers are on column D, simply make sure it says, ""D1"".  When you hit ""Enter"", your see the phone number appear on the cell.  Step 5: Copy the formulas all the way down using the ""Autofill"" function, which is draging the formula down by the little black dot on the bottom right corner of the cell.  That will copy and update each formula unto each cell as you drag down.  Step 6: Then you'll need to select all the cells on the new phone numbers column and select ""copy"".  Then click on the first cell at the top and right click hover mouse over ""Paste Special"" and click on the clipboard that says, ""Paste Values"".  Step 7: Delete the column with the original numbers and save your new file!  You're done!  I hope this was useful.  -Excalibur of BHT";"UC_Vf_qur3RR59NJA-ey4XiQ";"Excalibur Sword"

We created this series as an introduction to programming with Python.  Why Python? It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.  What you can do with Python is nearly endless:  Run powerful web applications Fly drones and launch rockets Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis Machine learning including deep learning And many more ways That list is fancy but don't let it scare you. Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.  The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.  Shakespeare had very few tools for writing plays and yet he continues to influence our entertainment despite being long gone. Creativity mixed with the right tools can transform how we do everything or why we do it.  That's why I want to teach you this tool. The world needs your creatively, your perspective, your project.

As Octoparse simulates human interaction with a webpage, it allows you to pull all the information you see on any website, such as Twitter. For example, you can easily extract Tweets of a handler, tweets containing certain hashtags, or posted within a specific time frame, etc.   All you need to do is to grab the URL of your target webpage and paste it into Octoparse built-in browser. Within a few point-and-clicks, you will be able to create a crawler from scratch by yourself. When the extraction is completed, you can export the data into Excel sheets, CSV, HTML, SQL, or you can stream it into your database in real-time via Octoparse APIs.   Step 1: Input the URL and build a pagination 1:24 Twitter applies “Infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to first scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.  Step 2: Build a loop item to extract the data 2:28 Make sure you go into the action setting of the “extract data” step. Click on the handler, and click “extract the text of the selected element”. Repeat this action to get all the data fields you want.  Step 3: Modify the pagination setting and execute the crawler 4:03 As we want Twitter to load the content fully before the bot extracts it, let’s set up the AJAX time out as 5 seconds, to give Twitter 5 seconds to load after each scroll.   Then, set up both the scroll repeats and the wait time as 2 to make sure that Twitter loads the content successfully. Now, for each scroll, Octoparse will scroll down for 2 screens, and each screen will take 2 seconds.   Head back to the loop item setting to edit the loop time to 20. This means that the bot will repeat the scrolling for 20 times.

Well, stay tuned - because I’m going to show you how to get this data in a few minutes using only your web browser.  Now, maybe you’ve seen my other videos on where I walk you through how to use the official Twitter API to collect data. However, a lot of you have complained to me about the Twitter API approval process, telling me they never get back to you, reject your application for no reason, or even suspend your app and never. even. respond. to your appeal after waiting for 2 months with absolutely no response.  And the sad thing is, most of these complaints I get are mostly from students just looking to get a little bit of targeted data for a school assignment or for research purposes.  I mean really Twitter? Really!? If only there were a social media platform I could voice my frustration on…  Well, the good news is that you don’t need to use the Twitter API to scrape reasonable amounts of Twitter data. See, when you browse around Twitter, you’ll notice a lot of these scrolling and pagination requests are happening dynamically, which means they’re sending structured data to our browser as we scroll through Twitter, in full accordance with their Terms of Service.  So if we can then access this data they sent to our browser after we’re done browsing Twitter, we’ll be good and have a copy of the Twitter data they sent to us during our browser session.  We can easily do this using a little known feature in web browsers known as a HAR file export… let me show you.  We just go to Twitter and then right click anywhere on the page and hit “Inspect” to open up developer tools. This will now “record” our web traffic during our Twitter session, so we can easily export a copy of the data that Twitter sends to us.  So let’s try a few things, like scraping tweets by hashtag - I just enter my hashtag in the search bar and scroll through all the tweets. When I’m done, I then go to the “Network” tab and hit “Export HAR…” to save a HAR file with the Tweets to my computer.  Ok, so now how do we get the data from the HAR file? How do we even open a HAR file? Well I’ve built a free tool I have linked to in the description: https://stevesie.com/har-file-web-scraper that will do this for you. You simply drag and drop the HAR file into your browser and it will process it for FREE, presenting you back with the raw JSON data from Twitter containing the tweets we just saw.  We can even search through the data to jump to the specific JSON response with your search term. And I can download each request here for FREE, seeing the raw JSON here. I can see the text of the Tweet, timestamp, mentions, images, videos, etc…  Now what if I need the data in a more usable format and combined together… like I ideally want all of the Tweets we looked at combined into a single CSV file instead of all these individual JSON files.  Well for premium Stevesie users, they’ll see this parse button here at the top of the request group. This will automagically parse the combined JSON responses together and convert it into “collections” which I can then download as CSV files containing all the Tweets here.  I can see all the combined Tweet contents, timestamps, hashtags, images, etc… all in one CSV file.  This approach should work with a lot of other Twitter data too - it looks like we just need to keep poking around the site and the free HAR File Web Scraper will help us access the raw data.  Now you may be asking, is this legal? Well keep in mind we legally used Twitter, right? The only thing we did differently was to record the network traffic that Twitter sent to our computer and then post-processed that logged data in a more usable format, like CSV format.  The only legal issue you could face here is if you do something not-so-nice with the data after scraping it - that’s where 9 / 10 of legal problems arise from when it comes to data scraping. E.g. if you re-publish the data somewhere else without permission, that would be bad. If you just want to use the data privately… that’s probably fine.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter API restrictions, developer terms, etc… they seem much more concerned with you disclosing any sensitive data, so be sure to read up on what you can re-publish to protect other Twitter users’ privacy.";"UCArmutk8nAbYQdaYzgqKOwA";"Stevesie Data"

In order to follow along, you will require:  1. A Twitter account,  2. Python.  Assuming you have both of these, go ahead and install the ""tweepy"" module by running the following command inside a terminal shell.  pip install tweepy   Once we have this, we make a Twitter application that will be used to interface with Python code we will write, and allow us to stream and process live tweets. After creating the Twitter application, we will leverage the ""tweepy"" module to stream the tweets.

If the data spans multiple pages, we also want to scrape those.  1:22 Data Scraping wizard The built-in wizard for data scraping is used to easily scrape our information of Amazon. To store our data a Data Table is defined in the outout. You can see a Data Table as an Excel sheet, but only existing while the workflow runs. Therefore we need to write out the Data Table to an Excel sheet to save the data.  2:33 Data spanning multiple pages UiPath prompts us automatically to indicate if our data is spanning multiple pages.

As Octoparse simulates human interaction with a webpage, it allows you to pull all the information you see on any website, such as Twitter. For example, you can easily extract Tweets of a handler, tweets containing certain hashtags, or posted within a specific time frame, etc.   All you need to do is to grab the URL of your target webpage and paste it into Octoparse built-in browser. Within a few point-and-clicks, you will be able to create a crawler from scratch by yourself. When the extraction is completed, you can export the data into Excel sheets, CSV, HTML, SQL, or you can stream it into your database in real-time via Octoparse APIs.   Step 1: Input the URL and build a pagination 1:24 Twitter applies “Infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to first scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.  Step 2: Build a loop item to extract the data 2:28 Make sure you go into the action setting of the “extract data” step. Click on the handler, and click “extract the text of the selected element”. Repeat this action to get all the data fields you want.  Step 3: Modify the pagination setting and execute the crawler 4:03 As we want Twitter to load the content fully before the bot extracts it, let’s set up the AJAX time out as 5 seconds, to give Twitter 5 seconds to load after each scroll.   Then, set up both the scroll repeats and the wait time as 2 to make sure that Twitter loads the content successfully. Now, for each scroll, Octoparse will scroll down for 2 screens, and each screen will take 2 seconds.   Head back to the loop item setting to edit the loop time to 20. This means that the bot will repeat the scrolling for 20 times.

Unfortunately, without an Instagram API, you cannot grab the email addresses listed in the ""Contact Us"" section of the business profile - you can only scrape the emails listed in their bios.

But in the real world, that's not always the case. There are numerous reasons why you might want to get data from a web page or multiple web pages, and there's no API in sight, and in that case you're going to need to fall back onto Web Scraping and Browser Automation.  In this screencast I'm going to give a high level overview of how to scrape websites, then cover five different scenarios, in increasing difficulty, for practical web scraping. There is a massive amount of information in this screencast and I'm going to straight up bombard you with it, but if you can make it until the end I guarantee you will come out knowing how to scrape websites with the best of them.

NOTE: The date in the video is showing when the investment funds are reporting the transaction in the 13F and not when the transaction took place. Normally, transactions are reported within 3 months (i.e. quarterly). Therefore, the transactions reported on the 11th of February have probably happened in December.

Maybe you read about them on Fortune magazine or somewhere else on the net. You want to get smart and to be able to have a conversation. We’re going to deliver to you today, a basic to intermediate understanding ""What is an API"", and how they’re important.  What sort of benefits you can get if you start to put them to use in your organization. In the first part of our API 101 video series, we build on concepts such as an API being a User Interface (UI) that is different from the UIs that we are used to such as the User Interface on a smart phone. We all know what to do with them. We can see them, use them, touch them, and we all have an expectation of how it’s supposed to work. Machines need their own interfaces, they don’t have brains, fingers or eyes. They need their own understanding of how to talk to each other. That understanding is what we call a contract.";"UCAjRNbDa8Bkg2KnvY3OD-zA";"ProgrammableWeb"

In this video we're rebuilding the entire HTTP server from Scratch in Go! And to make the challenge more fun I've defined some requirements (dictated by the capabilities I needed for the curl video). But that's not nearly all: During the entire video I'm not using any third-party packages, only the standard libraries that come with Go!  This video is not necessarily meant as a tutorial as I won't go into as much detail as I would in the other tutorials, but it's your change to pair-program with me for 50 minutes straight and watch me build a full REST API in one of my favorite programming languages: Golang. And it wouldn't be me if I wasn't using my favorite text editor in the world: vim. So be prepared for almost an hour packed full of Golang, vim, vim-go and probably a lot of compilation errors. ;-)  We're going to build GET and POST handlers to add and see our rollercoasters, we'll store them in a simple in-memory store, protected against concurrent read/writes using a Mutex and there'll even be a route that redirects you to a random coaster, as well as a section of the app protected by Basic Auth!

Click here to get started:  https://developer.mulesoft.com/tutorials-and-howtos/getting-started/hello-mule  Checkout the MuleSoft Platform here: https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api  The textbook definition goes something like this:   “An application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising each other. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks.   APIs often come in the form of a library that includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and variables. In other cases, notably SOAP and REST services, an API is simply a specification of remote calls exposed to the API consumers.  An API specification can take many forms, including an International Standard, such as POSIX, vendor documentation, such as the Microsoft Windows API, or the libraries of a programming language, e.g., the Standard Template Library in C++ or the Java APIs.  An API differs from an application binary interface (ABI) in that an API is source code-based while an ABI is a binary interface. For instance POSIX is an API, while the Linux Standard Base provides an ABI”.  To speak plainly, an API is the messenger that runs and delivers your request to the provider you’re requesting it from, and then delivers the response back to you.    To give you a familiar example, think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant.   Imagine you’re sitting at the table with a menu of choices to order from, and the kitchen is the provider who will fulfill your order.   What’s missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table.   That’s where the waiter (or API) comes in. ”AHEM”  The waiter takes your order, delivers it to the kitchen, and then delivers the food (or response) back to you. (Hopefully without letting your order crash if designed correctly)     Now that we’ve whetted your appetite, let’s apply this to a real API example. In keeping with our theme, let’s book a flight to a culinary capital – Paris.     You’re probably familiar with the process of searching for airline flights online. Just like at a restaurant, you have a menu of options to choose from ( a dropdown menu in this case). You choose a departure city and date, a return city and date, cabin class, and other variables (like meal or seating, baggage or pet requests)   In order to book your flight, you interact with the airline’s website to access the airline’s database to see if any seats are available on those dates, and what the cost might be based on certain variables.   But, what if you are not using the airline’s website, which has direct access to the information? What if you are using online travel service that aggregates information from many different airlines? Just like a human interacts with the airline’s website to get that information, an application interacts with the airline’s API.   The API is the interface that, like your helpful waiter, runs and and delivers the data from that online travel service to the airline’s systems over the Internet.   It also then takes the airline’s response to your request and delivers right back to the online travel service .  And through each step of the process it facilitates that interaction between the travel service and the airline’s systems - from seat selection to payment and booking.   So now you can see that it’s APIs that make it possible for us all to use travel sites. They interface with with airlines’ APIs to gather information in order to present options back to us   The same goes for all interactions between applications, data and devices - they all have API’s that allow computers to operate them, and that's what ultimately creates connectivity.  API’s provide a standard way of accessing any application, data or device whether it is shopping from your phone, or accessing cloud applications at work.

In this episode we are going to learn everything about state management in React.   The reason you might need a state management tool like the context api or redux, is to be able to share state between all your components in your react project.  We will focus on learning to context api today together with react hooks which is a new modern way of writing react code. The context api provides us with useful hook called useContext that lets us use a state in any of our components we want!  ❤Become a patreon for exclusive videos and more! https://www.patreon.com/dev_ed   🛴 Follow me on:  Twitter: https://twitter.com/deved94 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/ Github: https://github.com/DevEdwin  📕 Things covered in this video:   - React context api - React hoooks - Using context rather then redux  🎵 Music:  Outro:  LAKEY INSPIRED - Me 2 (Feat.

We created this series as an introduction to programming with Python.  Why Python? It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.  What you can do with Python is nearly endless:  Run powerful web applications Fly drones and launch rockets Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis Machine learning including deep learning And many more ways That list is fancy but don't let it scare you. Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.  The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.  Shakespeare had very few tools for writing plays and yet he continues to influence our entertainment despite being long gone. Creativity mixed with the right tools can transform how we do everything or why we do it.  That's why I want to teach you this tool. The world needs your creatively, your perspective, your project.

For example, there is a large set of unknown developers (LSUD) where and API provider puts an API on to the Internet and you really don’t know who’s going to be using it. The other grouping is a small set of known developers (SSKD) where you typically know who the developers are because they are either internal to the enterprise, or they are partners to the business in some way, or both.

The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But how do you protect access to your API? Which security aspects are no longer relevant? Which security features are an absolutely must-have, and which additional security measures do you need to take into account?  These are hard questions, as evidenced by the deployment of numerous insecure APIs. Attend this session to find out about common API security pitfalls, that often result in compromised user accounts and unauthorized access to your data. We expose the problem that lies at the root of each of these pitfalls, and offer actionable advice to address these security problems. After this session, you will know how to assess the security of your APIs, and the best practices to improve them towards the future.  Philippe De Ryck is a professional speaker and trainer on software security and web security. Since he obtained his PhD at the imec-DistriNet research group (KU Leuven, Belgium), he has been running the group's Web Security Training program, which ensures a sustainable knowledge transfer of the group’s security expertise towards practitioners.";"UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg";"Devoxx"

In this video, I tried to explain in details what an API is? How does it relate to web service? How does it relate to REST?  I also explain REST (REpresentational State Transfer). I explain how the concept relates to the WEB and to HTTP.  After that I talked about How RESTful APIs work with diagram and code. Finally, I give a short list of what you need to know to start building APIs. I know the video is sort of long, but I think it is worth your time.

If you need more help learning what your online course can do for your audience, watch the previous video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AEG7wJLh6U  For more about my marketing stack and why I chose this particular learning management software instead of clickfunnels, teachable or kajabi, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aShT4antRTc  this video is all about creating your online course. Specifically, you're going to learn my process that I've used to create over a dozen online courses. It's going to help you organize your thoughts, organize your curriculum, and really get your course created very quickly. We're going to jump on the computer and you're going to follow along while I go through this process. At the end, I'm going to share a solution, a location. You can go actually launch your courses online for free. You can put up to three different courses up on there and you can start selling them and earning income before ever having to invest in the technology or any specific software, which is great. And before we get in, I just want to cover the prerequisite to launching an online course. And the theory is that you already know exactly how to help other people get a very specific result.  Now, what does this result Moz? What your course is about, right? It can be anything. It could be how to podcast, it could be how to quilt. It can be how to knitting. It can be how to build a shed. It could be how to hit a golf drive, 200 yards. There's a lot of different things that you could be teaching people. How do you know what to teach them? Well, number one, you should already have been able to create this result for yourself. And number two, you should have already worked with individuals one on one coaching, whatever type sessions you do to help other people get this result. The key here is that you actually can help people get a result. That's when you're ready to lay out an online course. That's when you're ready to scale your kind of online business. So make sure you honor the fact that you need to be able to actually help people get results.  With that said, let's jump on the whiteboard here on my computer and let's map this all out. So I use what's called a three by three matrix, which essentially in its kind of simplest form is just a tic tac toe box to be honest, and you can modify from this. This is the starting point. You don't have to follow this exactly. If yours has four phases, that's okay. If you have five lessons and one of them, that's okay. But generally down the left side we have the different phases and then up here we have the different modules k. So we would have phase one, phase two, phase three and then we would have modules one, two and three but it works to where you got modules one, two, three on phase one after phase one there ready for phase two so it goes module four, module five, module six.  After that they hit phase three which is module seven eight, nine. Now this is totally abstract. I get it. I have a real example we're going to be working through here, but you need to understand this philosophy first, that you're helping people go through a series of phases and in each of those phases there's different modules and these are the milestones. So this is the prerequisite to part two and part two is a prerequisite to part three. And you've got to have phase one done before you can start phase two, which you go to number four, and so on and so forth. Is this making sense? Let me go ahead and clear the screen here so we can jump into an actual real world example. A, because I want you to see how this is gonna work in a real world example. So starting a social media marketing agency is what I'm gonna use as the example here.";"UC7RZRFCrN4XKoMsy5MgJKrg";"Miles Beckler"

Instructions are below:  Step 1: Open your CSV file.  Step 2: Insert a blank column to the right of the phone number column.  Step 3: Take not what column your phone number are on, for example, ""numbers are on column D""  Step 4: On the top blank field next to your phone column, enter the following expression below:  =--RIGHT(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE( A1,"" "",),""-"",),""("",),"")"",),10)  Notice the ""A1"" in the formula?  Simply change the ""A"" to the column where your phone number are.  For example, if your phone numbers are on column D, simply make sure it says, ""D1"".  When you hit ""Enter"", your see the phone number appear on the cell.  Step 5: Copy the formulas all the way down using the ""Autofill"" function, which is draging the formula down by the little black dot on the bottom right corner of the cell.  That will copy and update each formula unto each cell as you drag down.  Step 6: Then you'll need to select all the cells on the new phone numbers column and select ""copy"".  Then click on the first cell at the top and right click hover mouse over ""Paste Special"" and click on the clipboard that says, ""Paste Values"".  Step 7: Delete the column with the original numbers and save your new file!  You're done!  I hope this was useful.  -Excalibur of BHT";"UC_Vf_qur3RR59NJA-ey4XiQ";"Excalibur Sword"

And I made it my mission to learn what these traits are so I can replicate it for my own business and for my marketing clients. And today, I'm going to break down the exact process that you need to follow in order to write content that ranks on page one, step by step. Today, I'm going to break down how to write content that ranks on page one of Google, step by step.  RESOURCES & LINKS:  ____________________________________________ How to Write a Blog Post From Start to Finish [video]: https://youtu.be/Q8rN3JKqUc8 Ranking #1 With a New Website on Google in 2020 | Is it Even Possible? [video]: https://youtu.be/91W0sa9Qfg8 Rank Math - https://rankmath.com/ Ubersuggest - https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/ ____________________________________________  Step one, know your audience.   This is important because if you're writing for the wrong person, it doesn't matter where you rank, you're not going to do well. That traffic isn't going to convert into revenue, and you're going to be wasting time and money because you had to produce that content. You need to understand your target audience, what resonates with them, and what will bring value to their lives before you begin writing.  Also, you need to work on producing unique content that'll stand out from all the competitors, because there's already a tone of content out there.   So first off, go to Ubersuggest and type in keywords that you're trying to go after. It'll give you demographic information, it'll tell you the age range of the people searching. This will give you a good idea of this keyword is a good fit or not. It even tells you how many of those visitors actually click on the paid listings versus the free listings, versus no listing. And in the content ideas report, it'll show you all the content that's popular based off of Google search traffic, backlinks and social shares.   The second set is understanding the proven blog post on-page SEO process.  The process of structuring your content and optimizing for various elements of that page is the key to on page SEO. Optimizing your blog for keywords is one thing, but there's other factors within your content that can help you rank. So if you're on WordPress, you can just use a Rank Math, SEO plugin or iOS, either one work well. I found that Rank Math is a little bit better for you beginners, yourself. If you have a little bit money, their paid version is amazing. Another thing you can do is go to Ubersuggest, type in your URL, click on the site audit report in the left navigation, it'll tell you all the errors down on your web page and what you should fix. What you'll find in that Ubersuggest report is it breaks it down and priority with the top items being the ones that have the biggest impact to your traffic, and the items at the very bottom having the lowest and the least impact to your sure traffic.  The third step I have for you, is write blog posts that provide practical value to your audience.   Readers don't want generic blog post, they want something that's going to be worth their while. Something that they can finish with and be like, ""Okay, I'm going to go and do this now."" That's example of good piece of content.  You need to look at the questions that most people are typing in and looking for. Through Ubersuggests in the keyword ideas section, you can see a list of questions, that people type on a daily basis for the keywords that you're going after.  The fourth step I have for you is use the AIDA model.  Your job is write something that's captivating in the title that draws people in and makes people click through. Remember, a headline is so critical that 73% of buying decisions are made from the point where readers come in contact with your title. And as they say, eight out of ten people will read your headline but only two out of ten will click through and read the rest.   So make sure you focus on your headline. Now with interest you want to stimulate interest. It's important because it keeps the readers on your page and possibly on to other pages of your website. So you want to expand on what you're promising in your headline.   As for the desire, the best way to build a strong desire and your posts is to use bullet points. Not too many bullet points, but just enough to build the desire. Studies show that people are more likely to make a choice. When choices are limited. Keep this in mind with your readers as well.   ► If you need help growing your business check out my ad agency Neil Patel Digital @ https://neilpateldigital.com/   ►Subscribe: https://goo.gl/ScRTwc to learn more secret SEO tips. ►Find me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/ ►On Instagram: https://instagram.com/neilpatel/  https://youtu.be/pSWCotmPC58  #SEO #NeilPatel #DigitalMarketing";"UCl-Zrl0QhF66lu1aGXaTbfw";"Neil Patel"

Selenium WebDriver is an open-source tool for automated testing of web apps across many browsers. It provides capabilities for navigating to web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, and more.   ⭐ChromeDriver: ⭐ ChromeDriver is a standalone server that implements the W3C WebDriver standard. ChromeDriver is available for Chrome on Android and Chrome on Desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows, and ChromeOS)  ChromeDriver is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome. It is maintained by the Chromium team with help from WebDriver contributors.  Follow these steps to set up your tests for running with ChromeDriver: 👇 ✔ Ensure Chromium/Google Chrome is installed in a recognized location ✔ ChromeDriver expects you to have Chrome installed in the default location for your platform. You can also force ChromeDriver to use a custom location by setting a special capability. ✔ Download the ChromeDriver binary for your platform under the downloads section of https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ site and Help WebDriver find the downloaded ChromeDriver executable by specifying its location via the webdriver.chrome.driver system property (see sample below)   Sample Code: ~~~~~~~~~~ System.setProperty(""webdriver.chrome.driver"", ""/path/to/chromedriver""); WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();  ⭐ GeckoDriver: ⭐ ~~~~~~~~~~ geckodriver is an implementation of WebDriver, and WebDriver can be used for widely different purposes. How you invoke geckodriver largely depends on your use case.  If you are using geckodriver through Selenium, you must ensure that you have version 3.11 or greater. Because geckodriver implements the W3C WebDriver standard and not the same Selenium wire protocol older drivers are using, you may experience incompatibilities and migration problems when making the switch from FirefoxDriver to geckodriver.  Generally speaking, Selenium 3 enabled geckodriver as the default WebDriver implementation for Firefox. With the release of Firefox 47, FirefoxDriver had to be discontinued for its lack of support for the new multi-processing architecture in Gecko.  Selenium client bindings will pick up the geckodriver binary executable from your system’s PATH environmental variable unless you override it by setting the webdriver.gecko.driver Java VM system property  Sample Code: ~~~~~~~~~ System.setProperty(""webdriver.gecko.driver"", ""/path/to/geckodriver""); WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();  ============================================== ************** Checkout my other playlists ************** ============================================== Java Programming videos playlist:👇  🔗 https://bit.ly/3keRJGa  Selenium WebDriver with Java videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/2FyKvxj  Selenium interview questions videos playlist:👇  🔗 https://bit.ly/3matUB3  Windows automation with FlaUI videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/33CG4dB  CSS Selectors videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/2Rn0IbD  XPath videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/2RlLdkw  Javascript Executor videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/2FhNXwS  Apache POI videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/2RrngrH  Maven videos playlist:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/2DYfYZE  How to fix Eclipse errors:👇 🔗 https://bit.ly/3ipvNYf ============================================== ============================================== Connect us @ 🔗 Website - www.hyrtutorials.com 🔗 Facebook - www.facebook.com/HYRTutorials 🔗 LinkedIn - www.linkedin.com/company/hyrtutorials 🔗 Twitter - www.twitter.com/Hyrtutorials ============================================== ============================================== 🙏 Please Subscribe🔔 to start learning for FREE now, Also help your friends in learning the best by suggesting this channel.  #hyrtutorials #chromedriver #geckodriver #webAutomation #selenium  The following points can be covered in this video: ✔ how to launch firefox browser using selenium webdriver ✔ how to launch chrome browser in selenium webdriver ✔ geckodriver selenium ✔ geckodriver.exe download ✔ what is geckodriver ✔ gecko driver firefox ✔ chromedriver selenium ✔ chromedriver.exe ✔ selenium webdriver tutorial ✔ selenium testing tutorial ✔ automation testing tutorial for beginners ✔ selenium online training ✔ selenium chrome webdriver tutorial ✔ selenium java tutorial ✔ selenium webdriver";"UCzFPWBdClpZ9afmmyhho4Rg";"H Y R Tutorials"

As Octoparse simulates human interaction with a webpage, it allows you to pull all the information you see on any website, such as Twitter. For example, you can easily extract Tweets of a handler, tweets containing certain hashtags, or posted within a specific time frame, etc.   All you need to do is to grab the URL of your target webpage and paste it into Octoparse built-in browser. Within a few point-and-clicks, you will be able to create a crawler from scratch by yourself. When the extraction is completed, you can export the data into Excel sheets, CSV, HTML, SQL, or you can stream it into your database in real-time via Octoparse APIs.   Step 1: Input the URL and build a pagination 1:24 Twitter applies “Infinite scrolling” technique, which means that you need to first scroll down the page to let Twitter load a few more tweets, and then extract the data shown on the screen.  Step 2: Build a loop item to extract the data 2:28 Make sure you go into the action setting of the “extract data” step. Click on the handler, and click “extract the text of the selected element”. Repeat this action to get all the data fields you want.  Step 3: Modify the pagination setting and execute the crawler 4:03 As we want Twitter to load the content fully before the bot extracts it, let’s set up the AJAX time out as 5 seconds, to give Twitter 5 seconds to load after each scroll.   Then, set up both the scroll repeats and the wait time as 2 to make sure that Twitter loads the content successfully. Now, for each scroll, Octoparse will scroll down for 2 screens, and each screen will take 2 seconds.   Head back to the loop item setting to edit the loop time to 20. This means that the bot will repeat the scrolling for 20 times.

In order to follow along, you will require:  1. A Twitter account,  2. Python.  Assuming you have both of these, go ahead and install the ""tweepy"" module by running the following command inside a terminal shell.  pip install tweepy   Once we have this, we make a Twitter application that will be used to interface with Python code we will write, and allow us to stream and process live tweets.

We created this series as an introduction to programming with Python.  Why Python? It's a very popular way to writing computer programs and automations with board applications: SpaceX & NASA use it to launch rockets, Tesla with autonomous driving, Instagram as a web app backend, Intel to pilot drones/UAVs, and many many others.  What you can do with Python is nearly endless:  Run powerful web applications Fly drones and launch rockets Run autonomous robots like drones and self-driving cars Build connected systems with Arduino and Raspberry PI Automate business intelligences and perform financial analysis Machine learning including deep learning And many more ways That list is fancy but don't let it scare you. Python is just a tool for writing a series of step-by-step automation rules and that's exactly what software is: a collection of rules for a computer to follow.  The right tools in the right hands can impact the world in such amazing ways.  Shakespeare had very few tools for writing plays and yet he continues to influence our entertainment despite being long gone. Creativity mixed with the right tools can transform how we do everything or why we do it.  That's why I want to teach you this tool. The world needs your creatively, your perspective, your project.

(Tesla, Volvo, Google)";"Tesla has just launched its new self-driving semi truck, and other companies like Google and Volvo are hot on their tails in the self-driving automobile industry. But how do these cars actually work?  Subscribe to TheHub http://goo.gl/87YJzG   For copyright matters please contact us at: david.f@valnetinc.com  Soon, we’ll all be Knight Rider. You know, the main character on that 80’s TV show of the same name about a crime fighting hero and his talking car. Crazy, you say? Well, we live in a crazy world: a place where the automobile is finally automated and the self-steering steering wheel could be just within our figurative grasp.   We don’t know what the future holds, but we do know that previous generations had high hopes for what lay ahead. If you were to look at World’s Fairs and tech expos of 100, 50 and even 25 years ago, the industries of the past thought we’d be much further along than we are now. Just watch reruns of The Jetsons and you’ll see we’re nowhere near the flying cars and floating cities imagined by the animators of the 1960’s. But that doesn’t mean we haven’t taken technology insanely far in the time since the last industrial revolution. As a new period of massive change is upon us, it’s hard to really notice the huge advances occurring as we speak, from the tall cityscapes developing over our heads to the inner-data-spaces being explored by the phones in our pockets.   Sure, it’s scary. This technology could take away jobs from drivers and give machines more power than some ever thought possible. Even so, it’s interesting to see what’s actually true and what about these technological wonders has been exaggerated. Take off your blinders and let TheHub be your GPS as we guide you to the real story. This Is How Self-Driving Cars Actually Work.";"UC1USVpNwJDn6EiNwqxqT80g";"TheHUB"

We will see flying cars, self-driving cars, passenger drones, hyperloop one system that is projected to reach a top speed of 760 mph (1,220 km/h) and with Starship and the Super Heavy Rocket, most journeys will taking less than 30 minutes, with access to anywhere in the world in an hour or less.  Starship-Super Heavy Earth to Earth : With Starship and the Super Heavy Rocket, most of what people consider to be long distance trips would be completed in less than half an hour. In addition to vastly increased speed, one great benefit about traveling in space, outside of Earth’s atmosphere, is the lack of friction as well as turbulence and weather. Consider how much time we currently spend traveling from one place to another. Now imagine most journeys taking less than 30 minutes, with access to anywhere in the world in an hour or less. It's designed to service all Earth orbit needs as well as the Moon and Mars. This two-stage vehicle—composed of the Super Heavy Rocket (booster) and Starship (ship).  Hyperloop One : The Hyperloop is a new mode of transportation that moves freight and people quickly, safely, on-demand and direct from origin to destination. Passengers or cargo are loaded into the hyperloop vehicle and accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The vehicle floats above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag. Hyperloop One systems will be built on columns or tunneled below ground to avoid dangerous grade crossings and wildlife. It’s fully autonomous and enclosed, eliminating pilot error and weather hazards.  Underground Tunnels Transportation : To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight and won't fall on your head. A large network of tunnels many levels deep would fix congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew (just keep adding levels). Fast to dig, low cost tunnels would also make Hyperloop adoption viable and enable rapid transit across densely populated regions, enabling travel from New York to Washington DC in less than 30 minutes.  Pop.Up Next : At the heart of the Pop.Up Next concept is a simple two-seat passenger cabin that can travel one of two ways. The simpler and more conventional route involves attaching to a 60-kW (80-hp) electric powered sled and assuming the role of a self-driving car. Top speed is listed at 100 km/h (62 mph) and it would rely on a 15-kWh battery for a 130-km (81-mi) range. Pop.Up’s modus operandi is simple: passengers plan their journey and book their trip via an easy-to-use app. The system automatically suggests the best transport solution - according to user knowledge, timing, traffic congestion, costs, ridesharing demands - joining either the air or ground module or other means of transportation to the passenger capsule, and following passengers’ preferences and needs.  Renault Float : The Float is designed to take the social interaction of Facebook into the world of cars. The glass machine will look like a bubble when on the roads, floating around using magnetic levitation tech, while able to connect to other pods to create a weird bubblewrap-style convoy. Seats can swivel and sliding doors open to force you to interact while The Float can bob around in any direction. The concept also includes a smartphone app that lets you holler for a Float at any time – the Uber of the future, apparently.  Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion : The Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion research vehicle makes the future tangible with the revolutionary concept of autonomous driving. A luxury sedan with total connectivity between vehicle, passengers, and the outside world, it's a preview of how the self-driving car of the future could evolve into a platform for communication and interaction.  Transit Elevated Bus : Passengers on board the bus are expected to experience a ride comparable to riding in the upper level of a double decker bus. They will board and alight at stations at the side of the road with platforms at the bus floor height similar to stations of an elevated railway, or via stairs descending through the roof of the bus from a station similar to a pedestrian overpass. It will travel at up to 60 km/h (37 mph). Different versions will carry up to 1,200 passengers, with the larger versions being articulated to facilitate going around curves.  ----------------------- 🎵 Music List: ----------------------- Ender Guney Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHEioEoqyFPsOiW8CepDaYg Youtube Audio Library ● Stranger Danger - Francis Preve ● Parasail - Silent Partner --------------------------------- Thanks for watching, Please Subscribe :))";"UC3QR34uMm1pxfkZyUMeLhXw";"Thansis1997"

In the 16th century inventors invented a form of internal combustion engine based on black powder fuel to drive the piston movement. The way early internal combustion engines worked was to plug a piston to the top of the cylinder and ignite the gunpowder inside. These engines depended on changes in air pressure to move the piston, which is why they called atmospheric engine.   #Simplify #SimplifyTamil #ScienceTamil ****LIKE*****SHARE*****COMMENT********SUBSCRIBE********PRESS BELL ICON*****   Subscribe to Simplify Science in Tamil  https://bit.ly/subscribe-simplify  Follow Simplify Science in Tamil on instagram https://instagram.com/simplify_tamil  Like Simplify Science in Tamil Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/SimplifyTamil/  Write to Simplify Science in Tamil simplifytamil@gmail.com  ***LIKE பண்ணுங்க ******SUBSCRIBE பண்ணுங்க ********BELL ICON CLICK பண்ணுங்க DAILY ஒரு தகவல் உங்க போன் NOTIFICATION ன தேடி வரும்.";"UC_6w4KnZS_a4xi1pPlzA-4Q";"Simplify Tamil"

It is pivotal to one of the most established industries as autonomous driving changes the entire field from a sector providing a very hardware oriented product to offering personal mobility without the need to drive a car. Now, there are still many questions to be answered. As we are changing the paradigm of what an automobile is, not just technology solutions need to be found, but also business models will change and legal frameworks need to be adapted. This talk will look at the topic of autonomous driving from different perspectives and discuss what needs to happen to make a great vision become reality and change transportation forever.   About the Speaker: Dr. Sven Beiker is a Management Consultant specializing in technology and strategy, particularly in the automotive and personal mobility sector. In his professional engagements and publications he tackles the 4 major trends of automated, connected, electrified, and shared vehicles with projects ranging from research to product development and market deployment. In his career of 20+ years he has served in leading roles at BMW, McKinsey & Company, and Stanford University. He holds MS and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering / Systems Design. He also is a Lecturer in Management at the Stanford Business School.

As Amazon rolls out a one-day shipping guarantee for its 100 million Prime members, Amazon Flex drivers help solve the company's last mile problem. CNBC spoke to these on-demand contract workers all over the country to find out what it's really like to deliver for Amazon. Watch the video to hear about the pay, pace of work, and how Amazon Flex works.  Is Amazon Prime worth it? For many members, free shipping is a key Amazon Prime benefit that factors into their decision to pay $119 per year for the service. As Amazon starts offering Prime members the added benefit of one-day shipping they're working with on-demand contract drivers to help with this especially labor-intensive and expensive hand-delivery.  We spent a day with Omar Montes, a Flex driver in the San Francisco Bay Area. Omar helped a friend deliver around 46 packages in 3½ hours, for $105. “These are like the good days that make you want to continue doing Amazon. But, you know, there’s obviously bad days too,” Montes said.  » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic  About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Language might be described as the ability to take a finite set of elements (such as words), and using a set of rules (grammar and syntax) to create infinite combinations, each of which is comprehensible. Given this definition, it is perhaps not surprising then that cognitive psychologists sometimes speak of a ""grammar of action"".”  Yes, We Can Communicate with Animals https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/yes-we-can-communicate-with-animals/  “But I assure you, no dog (or ape) will ever learn words, lexigrams or gestures for “bacteria,” “economy” or “atom.” They may be able to hear or see the differences among them, but the concepts they represent are beyond their conceptual capacity. You can’t learn words for things you can’t understand.”  Chirps, whistles, clicks: Do any animals have a true ‘language’? https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/08/22/chirps-whistles-clicks-do-any-animals-have-a-true-language/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.45fa8c6f8e6b  “To be considered a true language, there are a few elements that are usually considered to be essential, says Kershenbaum. For one, it must be learned rather than instinctive — both whales and birds have this piece covered. For instance, killer whale calves learn a repertoire of calls from their mothers, and the sounds gradually evolve from erratic screams to adult-like pulsed calls and whistles.” ____________________  How close are we to colonizing the moon, mapping the human brain and curing cancer?

(Slacker.) Russell, who has already signed a deal to work with Toyota, says his sensor can see much farther and with better resolution than anything on the market now. But will it help us shift into autopilot?""  Introducing MARTY, Stanford's self-driving, electric, drifting DeLorean https://news.stanford.edu/2015/10/20/marty-autonomous-delorean-102015/ “In our work developing autonomous driving algorithms, we’ve found that sometimes you need to sacrifice stability to turn sharply and avoid accidents,” Gerdes said. “The very best rally car drivers do this all this time, sacrificing stability so they can use all of the car’s capabilities to avoid obstacles and negotiate tight turns at speed. Their confidence in their ability to control the car opens up new possibilities for the car’s motion. Current control systems designed to assist a human driver, however, don’t allow this sort of maneuvering. We think that it is important to open up this design space to develop fully automated cars that are as safe as possible.”  NACTO Releases the Blueprint for Autonomous Urbanism https://nacto.org/2017/10/31/blueprint-for-autonomous-urbanism/ ""The Blueprint outlines key tools and objectives for cities to use as they update their physical and digital infrastructure and on every type of street and intersection, from narrow, residential streets to major multi-modal boulevards. Future modules of the Blueprint will expand on these topics with new focus areas including roadway pricing, data partnerships with the private sector, regional planning, designing autonomous networks and autonomous freight delivery needs.""  ____________________  How close are we to colonizing the moon, mapping the human brain and curing cancer?

Autonomous cars have been in the works for a while now, with semi-autonomous options like collision avoidance, traffic-aware cruise control, and lane keeping becoming more and more common in even mid and low-price cars.  But thanks to companies like MobileEye, Cruise Automation, and Tesla, we are on the cusp of full Level 4 autonomy in the next few years. In fact, Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and more carmakers are planning to release fully autonomous cars in the years 2021 to 2025.  Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft stand the most to gain by this transition, which, according to technologist Tony Seba, will see the end of individual ownership of cars and become a Transportation as a Service model, where almost all travel is carried out through autonomous, shared vehicles.  And when these companies begin buying up fleets of self-driving cars, the cars they will lean on will be electric vehicles, due to the cheaper cost of electricity and the lower maintenance costs, as shown by the company Tesloop and their Tesla Model X that recently hit 350,000 miles.  Combine that with the lower cost of solar PV panels and Lithium-ion batteries, and we are setting the stage for a disruption of our transportation system like we've never seen before.

Do you wish it ran faster, using the full potential of your CPU?  Then you should try Numba, a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and Numpy code into fast machine code.  This talk will explain how Numba works, and when and how to use it for numerical algorithms, focusing on how to get very good performance on the CPU.  To understand this talk, only a basic knowledge of Python and Numpy is needed.  You will learn how Python compiles functions to bytecode and how Numba compiles bytecode to machine code. Why algorithms implemented using Numpy sometimes don't yield great performance, and how to do better using Numba. You will learn about the @numba.jit and @numba.vectorize decorators and how to create functions that use the CPU well by using e.g. multi-threading (several CPU cores), vector instructions (single instruction multiple data) and fast math (trade float accuracy for speed).  You will also learn when it does and doesn't make sense to use Numba, by contrasting it briefly with some other options for high-performance computing from Python: PyPy, C, C++, Cython, Numexpr, Dask, PyTorch, Tensorflow and Google JAX    License: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ Please see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/";"UC98CzaYuFNAA_gOINFB0e4Q";"EuroPython Conference"

I will briefly explain ways of profiling the code, discuss different code structures and show how they can be improved. You will see what is the fastest way to remove duplicates from a list, what is faster than a _for_ loop or how “asking for permission” is slower than “begging for forgiveness”.  -----  Did you know that Python preallocates integers from -5 to 257 ? Reusing them 1000 times, instead of allocating memory for a bigger integer, can save you a couple of milliseconds of code’s execution time. If you want to learn more about this kind of optimizations then, … well, probably this presentation is not for you :) Instead of going into such small details, I will talk about more _""sane""_ ideas for writing faster code.  After a very brief overview of how to optimize Python code (rule 1: don’t do this, rule 2: don’t do this yet, rule 3: ok, but what if I really want to do this ?), I will show simple and fast ways of measuring the execution time and finally, discuss examples of how some code structures could be improved.  You will see:   - What is the fastest way of removing duplicates from a list   - How much faster your code is when you reuse the built-in functions instead of trying to reinvent the wheel   - What is faster than the good ol’ _for_ loop   - If the lookup is faster in a list or a set (and when it makes sense to use each)   - How the “It's better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission” rule works in practice  I will NOT go into details of _""serious""_ optimization, like using different Python implementation or rewriting critical code in C, etc.";"UC98CzaYuFNAA_gOINFB0e4Q";"EuroPython Conference"

I take you through an example that shows what you can do with them. Python data classes are - as you'd expect - in particular suitable to model classes that represent data, and as such they offer easy mechanisms to initialize, print, order, sort and compare data.  Note that although I'm using a sort_index attribute, strictly speaking that's not needed in this case, because a data class uses a tuple of its attributes in the class definition as the default for sorting. I'm not a fan of this kind of hidden behavior, so I prefer to do it explicitly (using something that is called sort_index in this case). Another advantage of using a separate field, is that you can do more complicated ordering, using for example a weighted combination of age and strength.  Some interesting links: - https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/ - Frozen instances: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#frozen-instances - If you want to go 'next-level' with dataclasses, check out Pydantic (https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).

This is awesome, I mean this has been a marketer’s dream for decades so what’s the big deal?  Well for consumers, they feel like their privacy and their behavior is being exploited by advertisers. And the government has been launching investigations into Apple. So Apple may be blocking a lot of the “powers” of the Facebook pixel   I mean just last year, the CEO of Apple Tim cook had to testify before congress explaining their business and its intentions.   So of course, Apple is trying to tighten up their belts by making consumers feel more protected.

As it is clear Facebook is the biggest social network, and if you are a web miner and you want to access users account data that is explicitly available is by registering an application and using that application as the entry point into the Facebook developer platform, so the only data that is available to an application is whatever the user has explicitly  authorized to access.so if you want to get more information about this you can chek Facebook Platform Policies Document The Graph API is the primary way for apps to read and write to the Facebook social graph. All of our SDKs and products interact with the Graph API in some way,  and our other APIs are extensions of the Graph API, so understanding how the Graph API works is crucial.

Hi there! My name is Dan & I’m an Adobe Certified Instructor. I’m here to help you learn Adobe XD efficiently & comprehensively. XD is a fantastic design tool used by industry professionals to product high quality & functional mockups. By the end of this course, you will be able to produce practical & effective User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) designs.  This video is an excerpt from my full course. But in the short free UI course we'll cover lots of awesome things in Adobe XD.   Throughout the course I’ll invite you to participate in a real-life freelance project which I’m working on. It’s a project that requires a fresh website & mobile app interface. This will prepare you for dealing with real world projects if you choose to move towards a UX/UI career path.   This course is aimed at people interested in UI/UX Design. We’ll start from the very beginning & work all the way through, step by step. If you already have some UI/UX Design experience but want to get up to speed using Adobe XD then this course is perfect for you too!   First, we will go over the differences between UX & UI Design. We will look at what our brief for this real-world project is, then we will learn about low-fidelity wireframes & how to make use of existing UI design kits.   I’ll go over all of the essential tools necessary for creating excellent wireframes, including: type, colours, icons, artboards, prototyping, models & popups, symbols & repeat grids. We will even make use of the new prototyping app so that you can experience your prototype on your mobile device.   An important part of maximising your UX Design workflow is being able to utilise other software such as Photoshop & Illustrator. This is why I’ll be teaching you how to make use of both to help boost your XD productivity.   One of the awesome new features of XD is micro-interactions. I’ll be teaching you all about those & how to use them to grow icons & scenes. This is one of the parts of web design that’s growing & being adopted rapidly so you won’t want to miss out on learning it early.   There are two class projects for you to complete during this class, these will help develop your skills & will give you something for your own portfolio.   You'll need a copy of Adobe XD 2018 or above. A free trial can be downloaded from Adobe. No previous design experience is needed. No previous Adobe XD skills are needed.  What am I going to get from this course?  92 lectures of well-structured, step by step content. Learn to design websites & mobile phone apps. Fonts & colors.  Prototype your designs with interactions. Test on mobile phones. Send your designs for feedback & commenting Export production ready assets. Create your first UX brief & persona. Create quick wireframes.  How to use premade UI kits.  Learn professional workflow tricks & shortcuts You will get the finished files so you never fall behind Downloadable exercise files Forum support from me & the rest of the BYOL crew All the techniques used by UX professionals  This course is for beginners.  Aimed at people new to the world of design & user experience.  No previous Adobe XD experience is necessary. For anyone that needs to add ‘UX Design’ to their portfolio.

This is the only option Facebook was giving us and it's because they want you to spend money targeting broad interests, which are very competitive, so the price for ads goes through the roof.   So what I have for you today is the perfect solution which will allow you to tap into an ocean with 100s and 1000s of new interest nobody knows existed. All of that using the Facebook API and a copy and paste.   API Access: ******  How to use it:  1. Click or copy and paste the bitly link. 2. Change the keyword in the square brackets [dogs] with whatever interest you want. 3. Copy and paste the URL in your browser then copy and paste the results into a code editor. I use Brackets for MAC, but Notepad ++ or Sublime are also excellent editors. 4. Make a lot of money targeting interests no one else is targeting. 😎 5. IMPORTANT: If you have a long-tail keyword for example [dog lovers] to make the graph work   use ""+"" instead of empty space. Example: [dog+lovers]  *IMPORTANT*   Facebook Graph API:  👉*Update November. 2020* Due to so many people from youtube started using my access token, for the API Graph, Facebook disabled it. I shoot a video on how to create your own ""Facebook Acces Token"" watch it here: https://youtu.be/xwC--SJI2gQ   Cheers, Ross  P.S.

Please always learn from the source, and have the facts right. There is no room for speculation as breathing techniques can mean harm when not practiced right and when done in unsafe environments. Wim always runs his techniques by science. Among the universities; Harvard, Stanford, MIT,  Radboud UMC, AMC, Hannover University, and many more!

We don’t hold back on the good stuff❄️  - Don't take the method and techniques too lightly, they go deep and the effects can have a huge impact. - Don't do the breathing exercises in a swimming pool, before going underwater, beneath the shower or piloting any vehicle, without proper supervision. Always practice in a safe environment. - Keep in mind to do the exercises without forcing them, gradually build up, and don't exceed your limits. - Note that tinnitus symptoms may appear as a result of pushing too forcefully during the breathing exercise. If this happens, take a step back in your future practice, it’s important to increase gradually, not forcefully.  Love, strength and happiness to everyone!

Resolving the API Developer's Dilemma - Rob Crowley";"GraphQL, gRPC, REST and WebHooks are among a bewildering array of technologies and architectural styles that are available to API developers today. Presented with such myriad options, how can we be confident of making an appropriate decision for the problem at hand? In search of guidance, developers often turn to online communities. This can exacerbate the problem as discussions about API styles often descend into statements about the superiority of one approach over another being presented as universal truths. Such comments invariably earn emotive rebuttals that also lack sufficient nuance. The result of such exchanges is increased confusion and uncertainty. Join me on a tour of these API styles where we will cut through this noise, demonstrate where each style shines (plus where they don't!) and ultimately resolve this dilemma of choice.  In this session we'll take an in-depth look at API design; the best practices that have evolved; the game changing supporting technologies that are now available including HTTP/2; and most importantly what you need to do to deliver a world class developer experience:  How to determine the suitability of an API style for your application context. Don't be a victim of technology hype! What is required to support graceful evolution of the API contract including the potential implications of both Hyrum's Law and the Law of Implicit Interfaces Understand the supporting toolchains and technologies that dovetail with each API style. The importance of treating your API as a product with an unwavering focus on improving the ease of consumption for your clients. By the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning these various API styles but also have the knowledge to put them into practice. If you want to take to your API design expertise to the next level, then this is the session for you. See you there!

Class methods are methods that automatically take the class as the first argument. Class methods can also be used as alternative constructors. Static methods do not take the instance or the class as the first argument. They behave just like normal functions, yet they should have some logical connection to our class. We will look at some examples of both of these in order to understand both in depth. Let's get started.

Graph search methodologies apply well to problems that have an aspect of a spatial relationship.   Approach 1 (Brute Force)  We could try to enumerate all possible paths in the maze from the start to the finish and then check all paths to see if any of them are valid (have all white squares, aka do not run over a wall).  This is both naive and extremely costly in terms of time.   Approach 2 (Graph BFS or DFS)  We will imagine each cell as a vertex and each adjacent relationship as the edges connecting nodes.  Do we use DFS or BFS?  If we use BFS we know that the path that we find will be the shortest path because of how it searches (wide, going out layer by layer).  If we use DFS we can have the call stack remember the path making things easier to implement.  If we hit the end cell, then we will know that every call below in the call stack has a node apart of the answer path.  Since the problem just wants any path then we will use DFS since it is more straight-forward.   Complexities  Time: O( | V | + | E | ) The standard time complexity for DFS  Space: O( | V | ) We will at maximum the length of the path on the call stack through our recursion   Note: The problem on Leetcode requires BFS to pass because DFS will not always find the shortest path, but I did DFS in this video just for teaching purposes.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  HackerRank: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOf7UPMHBjAavgD0Qw5q5ww  Tuschar Roy: https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525  GeeksForGeeks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RhatS1pyxInC00YKjjBqQ  Jarvis Johnson: https://www.youtube.com/user/VSympathyV  Success In Tech: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-vYrOAmtrx9sBzJAf3x_xw  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  This question is number 19.1 in ""Elements of Programming Interviews"" by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.";"UCmJz2DV1a3yfgrR7GqRtUUA";"Back To Back SWE"

Timestamps: 00:00 Introduction 00:28 How Search Engines Work 1:01 Crawling 2:58 Indexing 4:22 Ranking 5:52 Important Ranking Factors  This can help you optimize your website according to Googleās best practices and improve your visibility in search results.  Crawling  Crawling refers to the discovery of all the pages on the web. Google has little programs called GoogleBots which are also known as crawlers or spiders. Crawlers start off by discovering only a few web pages and then follow the links on those webpages to find new pages, and so on and so forth. This way they discover billions of webpages on the internet to add them to Googleās database.   With a Robots.txt file in a websiteās root directory, webmasters can give directives to crawlers about which parts of their site the crawlers should and shouldn't crawl or index. For webpages that donāt need to be crawled or indexed, like test pages, a Disallow directive can be used. You can learn more about Robots.txt here: https://www.linkbuildinghq.com/beginners-guide-robots-txt/   A Crawl Stats report in the Google Search Console shows how many pages of a website have been crawled in the last 90 days. The Coverage report shows if crawlers are encountering any errors while crawling a website.   Crawlers have a Crawl Budget which refers to the average number of URLs Googlebot will crawl on a site before leaving. Therefore, it is important to optimize the Robots.txt file to ensure Google isnāt crawling unimportant or junk pages. With a sitemap, GoogleBots make sense of the site architecture and understand which pages the webmasters think are more important.  Indexing  While crawling is the discovery of pages, indexing handles the storing of the discovered pages in Googleās database or index.   By typing in āsite:yourdomain.comā in the search bar, you can know which pages of your website have currently been indexed. There can be a few reasons for webpages not being indexed which are discussed in this video.    Some common Robots.txt instructions for indexing include: ā¢ A NoIndex tag which can be used to tell Google which pages to crawl but not index. ā¢ A NoArchive tag to remove pages with outdated pricing. This is useful for ecommerce sites. ā¢ An X-Robots-Tag to exclude specific folders or file types from being indexed.   Ranking  Ranking refers to showing webpages in a certain order based on a search query. Google uses hundreds of mini-algorithms, or ranking factors, to assess where and when to show pages in its search results.  These mini-algorithms add up to form Googleās ranking algorithm which keeps updating to improve Googleās ability to show the most relevant and high on quality search results.   Depending on the search intent, the searcherās location, their search history, and other metrics, Google displays what it thinks are the most relevant results. Googleās ranking factors help the search engine in this process. There are over 200 ranking factors, but the most important ones include:   ā¢ Content Relevance  Relevance is among the most important ranking factors. Your content including your keywords needs to be relevant to the searcherās query. Conducting keyword research will help you find the right keywords to target.  ā¢ Content Quality  The quality of the content helps you stand out from your competition. Assessing the content in terms of its EAT (Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness) helps you with this factor.   ā¢ Quality Backlinks  Backlinks act like āvotesā from one site to another. Having backlinks from high authority websites improves this ranking for this factor.    ā¢ Mobile-Friendly Websites  With mobile-first indexing, your websiteās mobile version is now even more important than the desktop version. Therefore, ensure your website is fully optimized for mobile. If you want to learn more about mobile-first indexing, read this blog: https://www.linkbuildinghq.com/mobile-first-indexing-guide/    ā¢ Technical On-Page SEO  This includes having the right meta tags and headings, making sure your page can be crawled and indexed if you want it to rank, making it easier for search crawlers to understand your page, having a fast load time, using alt text for images, internal linking, having a secure site, deploying schema markup, and more.   Now that you have a solid grasp of how Google crawls, indexes, and ranks websites, itās time to move on to developing a winning SEO strategy. And it all starts with a solid keyword research plan, which is the main topic of part 3 of this series. Stay tuned!

This method is known as the PageRank algorithm which rates every web page on a scale of 0 to 10.  This video explains how the PageRank algorithm recursively propagates the importance of each web page through the link structure of the web.  It begins by introducing Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google.  It covers the importance of using Meta tags to include relevant keywords and descriptions in web pages before submitting them to a search engine for examination by a spider (web crawler).  It also emphasises the importance of hyperlinks.  This video describes how a web page obtains ālink juiceā from incoming links, and how this link juice is shared among the other web pages that it links out to.  With an example, this video demonstrates how the PageRank algorithm can be applied by first making a heuristic guess at any unknown PageRanks.  The formula is then applied repeatedly until reliable values have been calculated.  Finally, the video includes some tips on how you can boost the PageRank of pages in your own website.";"UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q";"Computer Science"

They are a fundamental method for searching relationships in a certain way and visiting nodes of any sort in a desired order.  These relationships may be represented in a graph, or we may be checking the distance one string is in character changes from another string, OR we may be traversing a tree a certain way.  These are searching concepts, not just graph concepts.   Implementation  DFS can be done iteratively using a stack or done recursively because the call stack will serve as the stack to remember points to backtrack to.  A stack structure can replace our stack frames from recursion, this is why DFS can be written recursively, due to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) of the order nodes are processed.  BFS is done iteratively. It uses a queue that has a First-In-First-Out processing order.   Use Cases  DFS is good for things like backtracking, getting to leaf nodes in a tree, or anything where we want to prioritize going very deep into a path and exhausting possibilities before coming back.  BFS is better for things like finding if a path exists between one node to another since it prioritizes width of search over depth (hence ""breadth-first"") and finding distance or ""levels"" something is away from something else.   The Method  1.) Choose the data structure based on the search. 2.) Add the start node. 3.) Remove the a node from the data structure. 4.) If the node has not been seen    4a.) Mark it as seen in the ""seen"" set.    4b.) Do work on the node. 5.) For each of the children    5a.) If child has not been seen (not bee processed)       5ai.) Add the child to the data structure.  Repeat while the data structure is not empty.   Time Complexities  If relationships are represented with an adjacency list then:  Time: O(V + E) Space: O(V)*  Where V is the total number of vertices (or nodes) visited and E is the total numbers of edges traversed.  *Although things will vary. We only care about the MAXIMUM amount of nodes in the data structure at one time. If we are doing DFS on balanced tree the space complexity would be O(h) where h is the height of the tree since we would only have a path h nodes long at MAX living on the stack. Same for if we do a level order traversal of a tree. The space will only be the MAXIMUM WIDTH of the tree because we would only keep that many nodes on the queue at MAX at one time. And on and on...just depends, ask your interviewer whether they want worst, average, or best case analysis.

These are crucial concepts in computer science and software engineering.  Stack memory: local variables and function calls are stored on the stack memory. The size of the stack memory is usually small BUT on the other hand it is quite fast. If we instantiate a new object then the reference itself is pushed onto the stack but the object itself is present on the heap memory.  Heap memory: it is slower than the stack memory but the size of the heap is far greater than the size of the stack memory.

This is why we can not apply the same approaches as we have seen with standard data structures (such as arrays, linked lists ...).  We will come to the conclusion that B-trees are the best data structures for organizing data on the external memory.

Chamath Palihapitiya, who grew Facebook and went on to found VC powerhouse Social Capital, sets us straight on the state of venture capital and markets today, and what we need to do to win. It’s a turbulent time to say the least; investors need to help founders hunker down and restructure how they’re spending money and get their business models working for escape velocity. (Hint: this does not include the use of ICOs, for which Chamath has many choice words….) Next is David Eun, President of Samsung NEXT who talks to Jason about his formidable work at AOL and Google, which led to him to Samsung and helping founders and startups. David nurtures innovation by meeting entrepreneurs wherever they are, a strategy that’s paying off with 23 (and counting) acquisitions in transformative software, including Smart Things leader in smart home.

FIRESIDE with Chamath Palihapitiya 0:36 Jason introduces Chamath Palihapitiya (CEO of Social Capital) to the Launch SCALE audience. 1:35 Chamath explains the story of how he managed to become an owner of the Golden State Warriors, and ultimately why he made the decision to own a professional sports team. 4:12 Chamath explains what has changed in startups. He calls it a “bleeding of talent.” Many more entrepreneurs/companies are being born all over the world, but lack the concentration of talent.   6:14 Chamath explains a problem in Silicon Valley of tremendous amounts of capital being invested into companies without adding true value. And his solution to fix this problem. 9:12 An important example of how Social Capital is adding value to their portfolio companies, by asking one simple question.   11:15 Thank you to LinkedIn for supporting TWiST. Go to http://linkedIn.com/twist for a $50 credit toward your first job post. 13:40 Jason talks about the illiquid IPO market, with companies deciding to stay private for longer. Chamath explains the importance of going public & rewarding your employees. 16:45 Google fact: An engineer obsoletes him/herself in 7 years. What does this mean for a company? Chamath explains the lifetime of businesses may be shrinking.   17:41 Chamath explains how Social Capital manages to recruit the best talent. “We only ever lose a race for human capital to Facebook & Google.” 19:00 Chamath explains his solution to solve the liquidity problem through his SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company), allowing companies to go public within 90 days. 21:31 Explanation of how a SPAC works. Chamath compares it to Facebook acquiring WhatsApp.   23:34 How Social Capital thinks about outsourcing knowledge to help build businesses. Chamath explains the benefit of “Knowledge as a Service”. 25:17 Thank you to Texture for supporting TWiST. Go to http://texture.com/twist to save 30% on magazine subscriptions.   27:00 Jason directs the conversation to cryptocurrency. Chamath gets heated & expresses his strong views towards ICOs/crypto-funds. Chamath: “Get back to core fundamental business practices.”     29:21 Chamath explains how Venture Capital will be disrupted by people creating value. And what it takes to build a great company. 30:38 Chamath talks about Slack, why he thinks they’re a fantastic company, and how Social Capital is helping them along the way. 32:23 Chamath explains his views on the Trump Presidency. “What is said, and what is done, have been two very different things.” 34:22 Chamath explains his view on the current economy. Comparing it to the last 30 years. And mentions that it is a scary time to invest in the public markets… right now. 37:12 Jason asks Chamath: What are your thoughts on Seed & Early-stage becoming less attractive to Venture Capital firms? Chamath explains why this is happening. 38:58 Jason takes notes from Chamath on how to make a syndicate better. And concludes the fireside chat. —————————————————————————————————————";"UCkkhmBWfS7pILYIk0izkc3A";"This Week in Startups"

Chamath previously was an early employee at Facebook, a prolific angel investor, and co-founder of the venture capital business that was the first version of Social Capital. He’s been in the press of late for raising and deploying a series of large SPACs and for his outspoken views.  Our conversation covers Chamath’s path to Facebook and Social Capital, his period of self-discovery, and the resulting Social Capital 2.0 to express his views of the world.  From there, we dive into SC Emerging Managers, Social Capital’s newest program to back managers from diverse backgrounds. Lastly, we circle back to the purpose of Social Capital and how Chamath gets it all done.";"UCbzQ_YWf9RsBP9ATbmv5kxQ";"Capital Allocators with Ted Seides"

Find me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/ Read more on my blog: https://neilpatel.com/blog  Today, I'm going to teach you guys all about growth hacking. You guys all familiar with the term? Alright, well now, you'll know how to do it for your business. You're not going to increase your revenue, your traffic, your sales unless you take growth seriously.   Whatever it may be, you've got to figure out what channels your customers are using. And most importantly, when you're trying to do growth, you can't just look at the most popular channels. These channels get crowded very fast.   Are you down with other people's platforms? The more people out there that you can target, right, the bigger your market that means there's someone else already out there with those customers. For example, if you're targeting a very small niche, there may not be a lot of other businesses with your exact customer base. But if you're going after something broad, someone out there who's not a competitor also has some of your same customers. For example, KISSmetrics does analytics. A lot of our customers use Google Analytics.   These integrations have to make your product better and the other person's product better. For example, Evernote has a lot of users. I sell analytics. Does it make sense for me to integrate with Evernote, a place where you take notes?   This will help you determine what the potential you can actually go for, because if your average user has 200 people in their contact list and they're only inviting 10 of their friends to use your service, your product, whatever it may be, that means you're not doing a good job with the invitation flow and the onboarding because you may be able to get 40, 50 of them to invite, right, instead of them inviting only 10 people.   The next one embeds. You've seen this one everywhere. YouTube, right? Why do people embed these YouTube videos? Most people do it because they're funny. These videos are very silly like they'll put a picture of a cute cat. I know they're really popular in the US, like aha, look at this cat, it's so pretty. And then people share it, and that's how they get millions of views because everyone's embedding them.   You also want to optimize for search but don't obsess about it. A lot of people when they do these embeds, they're like oh, we get backlinks. Do you know why backlinks are valuable? It's because you can get more search engine traffic, higher search engine rankings.   You also need to test your call to actions. We thought that putting like powered by KISSmetrics et cetera would be powerful. It wasn't that powerful. Instead, doing things like analytics by, right, so-and-so company or conversion optimization by so-and-so company converted better than just putting the words powered by.   How fast is your app compared to others? They do a benchmark. Another one, kits, ebooks, PDFs. All good examples of free stuff that you can end up using. When you're doing this free stuff, you need to map it out to the customer decision making.   Growth hacking isn't just about driving more users, it's about providing more value, benefit to your customers. If you can do that, they'll continue to use what you have to offer and tell other people about your company. You also have no excuses to make money. Just because you see companies like Pinterest, Snapchat, being worth billions of dollars without making any money, doesn't mean you can do that as well. Those are very rare cases. Even in the US, they're very rare cases. Even in Silicon Valley, they're rare cases. Focus on actually making money.";"UCl-Zrl0QhF66lu1aGXaTbfw";"Neil Patel"

Zhang, David R. Karger  UIST '16: ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology Session: Interaction & Obfusc**ion  Abstract Many people can author static web pages with HTML and CSS but find it hard or impossible to program persistent, interactive web applications. We show that for a broad class of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications, this gap can be bridged. Mavo extends the declarative syntax of HTML to describe Web applications that manage, store and transform data. Using Mavo, authors with basic HTML knowledge define complex data schemas implicitly as they design their HTML layout. They need only add a few attributes and expressions to their HTML elements to transform their static design into a persistent, data-driven web application whose data can be edited by direct manipulation of the content in the browser. We evaluated Mavo with 20 users who marked up static designs---some provided by us, some their own creation---to transform them into fully functional web applications. Even users with no programming experience were able to quickly craft Mavo applications.

We're going to be doing some coding, but don't worry. It's going to be pretty easy coding. So, let's get into it. So, we've opened up Dreamweaver. First thing we need to do is we need to create something called a site. So, go up to 'Site', along the top here, and go to 'New Site'. Give your site a name, you can call it anything you like, and we'll call this one, ‘Dans Portfolio’, and down here, this is the important bit, the local site folder. And, all this does, is tell our Dreamweaver where you're going to keep your website on your computer. Now, you need to keep all of your files in this one folder.

We will build 4 sites together in the full course: a simple but elegant restaurant website. a bike repair website.  a responsive portfolio website. a Bootstrap website.    We cover everything you need to build your first website. From creating your first page through to uploading your website to the internet. We’ll use the world’s most popular (and free) web design tool called Visual Studio Code.  There are exercise files you can download and then work along with me. At the end of each video I have a downloadable version of where we are in the process so that you can compare your project with mine. This will enable you to see easily where you might have a problem.  We will delve into all the good stuff such as how to create your very own mobile burger menu from scratch learning some basic JavaScript and jQuery.

This is the programmer life in Japan.  As a Japanese game programmer you'll see what it is like commuting to work in Tokyo and going to work at one of the largest Video Game Studios in Japan as well as working with other Japanese video game developers, software engineers, video game devs, game designers and even Japanese game directors for a major Japanese Video Game studio.  We follow Masa, a 23 year old, Japanese programmer, throughout his workday and witness what he does during his Japanese working hours as a Japanese game programmer at the Bandai Namco Studios office in Tokyo.  We'll even interact with directors from popular Japanese video game titles such as Tekken and CodeVein.  Plus we'll get to see what a Japanese programmer from one of the large Video Game companies in Japan does after work with friends.  This look inside a Japanese game dev's life is pretty unique and should provide some insight for those people who want to work in Japan as a game developer or game programmer.  Also, this day in the life of a Japanese programmer will show you what it takes to be a Japanese programmer.  As you would expect, most of the work day is spent programming and coding, but there are other unique aspects of the Japanese programmers life we are able to see in this video.

HTML is the most widely used language for developing web applications. It was created by Berners-Lee in the year 1991 but was first published in 1995. HTML 4 was a popular breakthrough version and got published in 1999. This version gained a lot of popularity and was adopted all over the globe for developing web applications. HTML 5 is the current version and was published in 2012. HTML is critical for web development, and if you’ve ever thought about choosing that career path, you’d unquestionably have come across this language. And that’s probably why you are here in the first place.  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used for creating websites and web applications. Let’s break it down, so we understand the name better: HyperText: HyperText refers to the “text wrapped within a text.” It is very similar to hyperlink and contains an underlying text that, when clicked, redirects to a new webpage. Markup Language: A markup language is not necessarily a programming language. Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document. This leads to more interactive and dynamic text content. Web Page: A web page is a document that is commonly coded in HTML and rendered by a web browser. Every web page is identified by a URL and can be static or dynamic according to the requirements. If we are only using HTML for development, we can create static web pages.  To learn about HTML and we developement, check our Full Stack Java Developer program: https://www.simplilearn.com/java-full-stack-developer-certification-training-course?utm_campaign=HTMLiin10Min&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=youtube  About Full Stack Java Developer Program: This Full Stack Java Developer Job Guarantee Program is a comprehensive six-month program, in partnership with HIRIST and HackerEarth, is designed to fast track your career as a Full Stack Developer focusing industry demand, with a starting salary of up to ₹5 LPA.

A lot of people are learning JavaScript to become front-end and/or back-end developers.   I've designed this JavaScript tutorial for beginners to learn JavaScript from scratch. We'll start off by answering the frequently asked questions by beginners about JavaScript and shortly after we'll set up our development environment and start coding.   Whether you're a beginner and want to learn to code, or you know any programming language and just want to learn JavaScript for web development, this tutorial helps you learn JavaScript fast.   You don't need any prior experience with JavaScript or any other programming languages. Just watch this JavaScript tutorial to the end and you'll be writing JavaScript code in no time.   If you want to become a front-end developer, you have to learn JavaScript. It is the programming language that every front-end developer must know.   You can also use JavaScript on the back-end using Node. Node is a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. With Node and Express (a popular JavaScript framework), you can build back-end of web and mobile applications.   If you're looking for a crash course that helps you get started with JavaScript quickly, this course is for you.   ⭐️TABLE OF CONTENT ⭐️  00:00 What is JavaScript 04:41 Setting Up the Development Environment  07:52 JavaScript in Browsers 11:41 Separation of Concerns 13:47 JavaScript in Node 16:11 Variables 21:49 Constants 23:35 Primitive Types  26:47 Dynamic Typing  30:06 Objects 35:22 Arrays 39:41 Functions 44:22 Types of Functions   ⭐️Related Tutorials ⭐️ Node tutorial for beginners:  https://youtu.be/TlB_eWDSMt4  Express.js tutorial for beginners: https://youtu.be/pKd0Rpw7O48  React tutorial for beginners: https://youtu.be/Ke90Tje7VS0  Angular tutorial for beginners:  https://youtu.be/k5E2AVpwsko";"UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA";"Programming with Mosh"

The second reason is to bring back the fun and joy of coding your own web site from scratch without using any fancy technologies or frameworks. And the third reason is to use this web site as my own personal information organizational tool. So I can keep some of the most important thoughts, skills that I'm trying to develop, quotes and articles organized.   I'm also using it as a launchpad for my new project called Life Craft which is a YouTube channel and a web site for personal development.  The web development field is filled with all kinds of languages and technologies and many people start learning the latest frameworks without even understanding what they are for. Knowing these latest programming languages can be good if you're looking to get hired, but Clever Techie is more about the passion of coding your own projects, building your own web sites.   In this video I'd like to bring back that passion of creating your own web site, while understanding every piece of code that you write and only adding and upgrading technology if necessary.
